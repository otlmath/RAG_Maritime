B.1.ORIGIN IN 
ACCIDENTS OF THE A.INTRODUCTION
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the nati on’s leading marine safety 
organization and has broad, multifaceted jurisdictional authority and responsibilities.  
In executing these responsibilities, the Coast Guard relies upon the information it 
develops through detailed investigation of various occurrences.  The specific statutory 
basis for the Coast Guard’s Marine In vestigations Program come from various 
statutes, including Title 46, U.S . Code (USC) Part 6301, which is indeed expansive:    
“The Secreta ry shall prescribe regulations for the immediate investigation of marine 
casualties un der this part or decide as closely as po ssible -  (1) the cause of the 
casualty, incl uding the ca use of any death; (2) whether an act of  misconduct,
incompetence, negligence, unskillfulne ss, or willful violation of federal law committed 
by any individual licensed under Part E of this subtitle has contributed to th e cause of 
the casualty, so that appr opriate remedial a ction u nder Chapter  77 of this title may be 
taken; (3) whether an act of  misconduct, incompetence, negligence, unskillfulness, or 
willful vio lation of law committed by any person, including an officer, employee or 
member of the Coast Gu ard, contributed to th e cause of the ca sualty, or to a death 
involved in the casualty; (4) whether ther e is evidence tha t an act subjecting the 
offender to a civil penalty under the la ws of the United States h as been com mitted, so 
that appropri ate action m ay be undertaken to  collect the p enalty; (5) wheth er there is 
evidence tha t a criminal a ct under the laws  of the United States has been committed, 
so that th e matter ma y be referred to appr opriate authorities for prosecution; and (6) 
whether th ere is need for new laws or regula tions, or amendment or repeal of existing 
laws or regulations, to prevent the recu rrence of the casualty.” 
After a long series of marine incidents in the early 1800s invo lving heavy losses of life 
and property, Congress enacted its first marine safety legislation and created a federal 
organization, the Steam boat Inspection  Serv ice, to preserve and protect th e public 
from preventable marine incidents.  The Coast Gu ard's current marine safety 
programs retain the philosophical objective s of those historical preservation and 
protection pr ograms.  In the modern world, a myriad statutes a nd regulations affect 
the marine environment and the mari ne industry.  This resulted in the creati on of 
several distinct Coast Gu ard programs c oncerned with marine sa fety and related 
issues: Commercial Vess el Safety (CVS), Port and Environmental Safety (P ES), 
Marine Environmental R esponse (M ER), Waterways Management (WWM), 
Recreational Boating Safety (RBS), an d Bridge Administration (BA).  The Marine 
Investigations Program supports all of these statute driven programs. 
B.HISTORY
The Coast Guard’s Marine Investigations Program  has been a v ital arm of its marine 
safety activiti es since the 1830’s when the program’s predecesso r, the Steam boat 
 1830S
B.2.TWO 
OBJECTIVES OF THE 
PROGRAM
B.3.LEADERSHIP
C.1.
INTRODUCTIONInspection Service, was established.  In 1832 alone, approximately 14% of the steam 
vessels in operation were destroyed by expl osion and over 1000 people were killed.  
These explosions happen ed largely because there were no vess el inspection  laws or 
rules of navigation.  In some cases, ma riner incompetence, negligence, and/o r 
misconduct were contrib uting causes.  The U.S. Congress reacted to thes e facts by 
establishing inspection la ws and creati ng the Steam ship Inspection Service.  
Subsequent revisions to the law crea ted both the Vessel Inspection and Marine 
Investigations Programs, whose precepts are largely unchanged  in today’s Coast 
Guard: 1) to ensure that li censed mari ners were co mpetent (an d to revoke those 
licenses upon evidence o f incompetence); 2) to en sure that the vessel safety laws were 
observed; and 3) to suggest where new laws or inspection rules were necessa ry to 
save lives.   
The two obj ectives given the Revenue Cutter Service and th e Steamboat Ins pection 
Service are every bit as ap propriate and as challenging today as they were when 
issued. The Constitution must be conscienti ously upheld, but this priority must be 
accomplished while at th e same tim e 1) thor oughly determine the causes of incidents, 
and 2) effectively detecting and apprehending those who would circumvent the laws 
of our nation for personal reasons and priva te gain.  We must also strive to conduct 
investigations in such a way that compliance is our goal, not imposing penalties.  All 
the while, we must safeguard lives at sea and the environment by finding out why 
incidents occur and eliminating those causes, whether those ca uses have la w 
enforcement consequences or not. 
Over the spa n of our more than two h undred years, the Coast Guard has ea rned a 
reputation as  the world’s premier maritime law enf orcement an d marine safety 
organization.  Today, our expertise in thes e areas is internationally recognized,  and we 
continue to l ead the international com munity forward.  Marine safety person nel must, 
therefore, uphold and enhance our preeminent reputation as the Coast Guard moves 
into its third century of service. 
C.OVERVIEW OF THE MODERN MARINE SAFETY PROGRAM
The historical missions have evolved into the mod ern personnel action and marine 
casualty investigation segments of the Mari ne Investigations Program; one of the 
primary purposes in conducting marine inve stigations is to deter mine if misconduct 
or negligence on the part of licensed mariners contributed in any way to ca using an 
incident.  Our investigation and law enforcement roles have grown since 1852, 
however, to include investigation into recr eational b oating death s, detecting violations 
of criminal and other statutes for law enforcement purposes, taking remedial law 
enforcement action such as civil penalties and suspension and revocation, 
investigating pollution, and enforcing inter national treaties such as the Intern ational 
Convention on Load Lines, 1966 (ICLL), the International Convention for the Safety 
of Life at Sea 1974 (SOLAS), the Intern ational Convention on Standards of Training,

Convention for the Preve ntion of Pollution from Ships, 1973 , as amended 1 978 
(MARPOL 73/78). 
The Marine Investigations Program accomplishes its mission through the 
investigation of various incidents, and thro ugh various follow -up activities designed 
to ensure these incidents are not repea ted.  Investigative activities are intended to 
uncover the causes of incidents, document the events and their causes, and i nitiate 
the necessary corrective a ctions.  Investigat ions also detect and suppress federal law 
violations.  Accordingly, this manual a ddresses itself primarily to the on-scene 
investigative process as th e principal vehicle for the program. 
There are four fundamental principles upon which the conduct of all marine 
investigations is based.  First, Congress cl early intends the Coas t Guard to investigate 
many incidents and to b oard vessels subject to  U.S. jurisdiction to enforce applicable 
maritime laws.  Second, compliance with la ws and principles protecting lives and the 
environment is the Coast Guard’s objective, not pu nishment.  Third, the vast 
majority of the vessels and shore facilities that are s ubject to Coast Guard jurisdiction 
are operated by law-abiding mariners and facility personnel who are entitled  to be 
treated wi th the utmost courtesy and r espect.   Fourth and finally, the safety o f Coast 
Guard personnel is always a vital concern.  The continuing challenge is to optimize 
the balance of these elements in each situation.  
D.PURPOSE,ORGANIZATION , AND USE OF THIS VOLUME
This manual outlines the domestic and internation al law and p olicy framework for 
marine safety investigations activities  and gives fundamental p olicy guidance and 
operational procedures for the Marine Investigations Program. 
This manual briefly addresses the Operational Law Enforcemen t Program to provide 
a general sense of Coast Guard responsibilities in this area.  The underlying intent is 
to provide marine safety personnel with suffi cient guidance to enable them to take 
prompt actio n when urgently required, and/or to refer emerging cases to Co ast 
Guard experts in the Operational Law Enforcemen t Program.

INTRODUCTION
B.2.GEOGRAPHIC A.AUTHORITY VERSUS REQUIREMENT TO INVESTIGATE
In considering how operational investigative resources will be deployed, 
Commanding Officers and their personnel shou ld carefully consider their general 
legal authority to investigate various types of incidents along with any specific legal 
mandates rel ated to the i ncident.  The mere existence of legal authority does  not 
automatically mandate tha t the Coas t Guar d investigate.  There is a distinction 
between the authorities to investigate versus a requirement to in vestigate. 
In general terms, the Coa st Guard has  been granted legal authority to investigate 
various incidents based u pon various statutes  and regulations.  These legal authorities 
can loosely b e thought of as permission to conduct investigative activities an d as 
granting powers to the In vestigating Officer (IO). 
In some instances, there has been con fusion as to the legal auth ority to investigate 
versus a legal mandate for  the Coast Guard to investigate.  The authority to 
investigate should be viewed separately from  the requirement to investigate (if any 
exists).  46 USC 6301 requires  the Coa st Guard to investigate certain incidents.  The 
implementin g regulations in 46 CFR 4 perm it the Coast Guard  to determin e the level 
of investigation and investigative effort.  In considering whether the Coast G uard is 
required to investigate, th e IO should l ook for specific statutory or regulatory 
language mandating the investigation. 
There has been confusion with the req uirement tha t the public r eport certain
incidents versus the Coast Guard’s legal author ity to investigate that incident or with 
the legal requirement tha t the Coas t Guard investigate the inci dent.  Reporting 
requirements should be viewed as co mpletely separ ate from both the authori ty to 
investigate a nd the requirement to inv estigate.   
Of note, IO’s often cond uct investigations un der multiple authorities.  Due care must 
be taken to u nderstand th e powers an d limitations of each auth ority in order not to 
exceed tha t authority, possibly tainting your  case by acting beyo nd the scope of the 
authority. 
B.LEGAL AUTHORITY –GENERAL
In general terms, when we speak of legal authority, we are sayin g that a speci fic 
statute or reg ulation allows or mandates for the Coast Guard to investigate.  
Jurisdiction covers where, when, and o ver whom th at authority i s exercised.  When 
conducting a n investigation you must estab lish both authority and jurisdiction before 
you begin.   
Geographic jurisdiction is defined as the territo rial range of authority or control.  In

INTRODUCTIONgeneral, the Coast Guard ’s geographical jurisdiction is from the waterfront seaward 
and all navigable internal /inland waters.  Specific jurisdictional boundaries are defined 
in various statutes depending upon the issue in question. 
In broad terms, the Coas t Guard has author ity over all U.S. ve ssels regardless of 
location anywhere in the world, and over all vessels located within U.S. waters. 
In broad terms, the Coas t Guard has certain authorities over owners, operators, 
managing operators, agents, masters, a nd indi viduals in charge of U.S. vessels and all 
vessels in U.S. waters.  Additionally, th e Coast Gu ard has authority over personnel 
holding a U.S. Coast Guard issued Merchant Mariner Credential  (MMC). 
In addition to geographical area, vessels, an d people, the Coast Guard has jurisdiction 
over certain acts.  These include marine casua lties, oil spills, and  marine violations, to 
name a few.
C.GENERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES
The Coast Guard has broad authority to  conduct many different types of 
investigations of many different actions in the maritime arena.  Coast Guard

INTRODUCTION33 USC 1227 authorizes the Secretary to investigate any inciden t, accident, o r act 
involving damage to a wa terfront facility, or  which affects or may affect the s afety or 
environmental quality of the ports, harbors, or  navigable waters of the United States.  
Additionally, this section gives the Secr etary the po wer to issue subpoenas. 
The Secretar y has delegated the auth ority to Com mandant via Departmen t of 
Homeland Security Delegation Number 0170.1.  The delegati on is through the Port 
and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, which amen ds the Port and Waterways Safety Act 
(PWSA).  The Command ant has deleg ated aut hority to conduct investigations and to 
issue subpoenas under 33 USC 1227 t o the Captain of the Port (COTP).  The COTP 
may authorize IOs to issue subpoenas under 33 USC 1227 on his or her behalf.  Such 
authority sha ll be granted in the IO’s letter of designation. 
43 USC 1348 provides for the investigation of casualties resulting from ope rations on 
the Outer Continental S helf (OCS).  Addi tionally, it authorizes the issuing of 
subpoenas and administering of oaths to witnesses .  This authority is delegated to the 
IO in 33 CFR 140. 
46 USC 3315 requires the disclosure of certain ma rine casualties by licensed
individuals during an inspection or investigation.  Note:  This is not an addi tional 
reporting requirement. 
Requires a Marine Safety Information System (MSIS) and authorizes collecti on of 
histories of vessels that operate on the na vigable waters of the U.S.  The Marine 
Information for Safety and Law Enforcemen t (MISLE) data system replaced MSIS. 
46 USC 6101 requires the reporting of ma rine casualties and incidents involving 
United States flag vessels occurring anywher e in th e world, and foreign flag vessels 
operating on the navigable waters of the United States. 
46 USC 6301 provides the authority to conduct m arine casualty investigations, as well 
as sets forth the scope of the investigat ion of marine casualties and incidents.  
Provides an IO who is conducting a marine  casualty investigation with the necessary 
subpoena au thority to require the attend ance and testimony of witnesses and the 
production of evidence. It also authorizes a district court of the United States to 
direct compli ance with a s ubpoena.

authority in quantities th at may b e harmful.  Also, jurisdiction is extended to the high 
seas if you can prove that a discharge will im pact the coastline of the United States or 
natural resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). 
Additionally, it authorizes the Coast Guar d to issue and enforce pollution prevention 
regulations; to assess penalties for unlawful discharge of oil an d hazardous 
substances, and for violation of preventi on and removal regulati ons; to require 
vessels to have evidence of financial res ponsibility; and to require notification of 
discharges. 
E.3.b.  Delegation of Authorities Guard has jurisdiction to conduct poll ution investigations.  Many of the statutes for 
pollution investigations are the same as  those for marine casualty investigations. 
The same authority that allows marine casua lty inv estigations of waterfront facilities 
also authorizes the Secretary to invest igate actions by or involving waterfront 
facilities, which affect or may affect the en vironmental quality of the ports, harbors, 
or navigable waters of the United States. (See D.2 above) 
It also authorizes withhol ding of a cleara nce or per mit if any owner, operator, or 
person in charge of a vessel is liable or believed to be liable for a civil penalty under 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA).  Finally, this section gives the 
Administrator or Secretary the power to issue subpoenas. 
The Secretar y has delegated the auth ority to Com mandant via Departmen t of 
Homeland Security Delegation Number 01 70.1.  The Comma ndant has delegated 
authority to conduct investigations and to  issue subpoenas under 33 USC 1321 to the

B.COMMITMENT TO PROFESSIONALISM
The Coast G uard has earned an excell ent reputatio n as the worl d’s premier marine 
safety organization.  In order to maintain the high level of performance tha t led to 
this reputati on, all marine safety pers onnel must make a perso nal commitment to 
professionalism in all aspects of their du ties.  Investigating Officers (IO) sh all 
maintain the highest stand ards of ethical conduct as  law enforcement officers and 
public servants.  
IOs must not display a narrow, rigid, o r arbitrary application of the law.  IOs must 
always remember that no  action shoul d be taken without consid ering whether it is 
truly in the p ublic interest. 
IO’s must afford every person involved in an  investigation his or her legal rights and 
respect th e dignity of every human bei ng.  IOs should not cond one violations of the 
law, but the proper target of their efforts is the beh avior, not the person.  
IOs must be courteous and profession al.  The Coast Guard depends on the l aw-
abiding public for inform ation. IOs can only obtai n this inform ation in an 
atmosphere of cooperation in the interest of  marine safety.  IOs must beli eve in the 
policies of the Marine Investigation Program, and must convince the public of the 
program’s va lue.  Courtesy and tact ar e the keys to achieving public cooperation.  The 
best possible relationship with the public and mariners is through courtesy, fairness, 
and impartiality without s acrificing professional dignity and integrity, even under the 
strongest provocation.  IOs are amba ssadors of the Marine Safety program and 
should promote its goals. 
IOs must ha ve a fair and impartial atti tude toward matters under investigation, and 
must not be influenced by political, economic , or social considerations.  Further, IOs 
must be careful not to let past professiona l experiences or regulatory agenda s bias 
 their views or the investigation.  Allowing such biases will compromise the fact-
finding and policy feedback purposes of the investigation.  The fact-finding and 
analysis stages of the investigation s hould remain two separate stages of the 
investigation to eliminate or reduce bias.  IOs must be cautious i n their remarks and 
actions during the course of an investigation, keeping in mind that remarks, actions, 
and motives can easily be misinterpreted by the pub lic.

C.3.TWO PERSON 
INVESTIGATIVE 
TEAMSAs a matter of policy, IOs shall, wherever  operational limitations permit, deploy to 
the field investigative tea ms consisting of at least two individuals.  Two person teams 
allow for greatly increased safety and securi ty, as well as improving the quality of on-
scene investi gation.   
C.4.SAFE WORK 
PRACTICESInvestigations are not strictly confiden tial, and IOs may release i nformation 
reasonably d emonstrated to be factual to the press or public.  IOs must car efully 
observe, however, the provisions of t he Pr ivacy Act and th e Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) in these releases.  Coast Guar d personnel shall not disclose the names of 
individuals employed on any vessel who provide information about defects and 
imperfections in matters s ubject to reg ulation and inspection ( 46 US C 3315(b)).  To 
do so subjects an IO to significant penalties. 
IOs can benefit from discussing cases with other i nvestigators, particularly more 
experienced i nvestigators.  IOs should be cautious, however, in discussing cases with 
personnel outside the Coast Guard, even wh en the Coast Guard  is cooperati ng with 
other agenci es in the investigation.  Discussions should avoid speculation, opinion, 
and the Coas t Guard’s strategy in the i nvestigation.   
C.SAFETY OF COAST GUARD PERSONNEL
The safety of  USCG personnel involved in Marine Safety operations must al ways be a 
paramount concern.  While a reasonable mea sure of risk-taking is inherent in our 
service, IOs must take all reasonable step s to maintain personal safety,  including 
adhering to minimum safe work practices and oth er policy respectively con tained 
within the M arine Safety Manual, Volume I, Chapter 10 and subsequent ap pendices 
(CIM 16000.6) and the Sa fety and Env ironmental Health Manu al (CIM 5100.47). 
Virtually all Marine Safety activities condu cted du ring an investigation occu r with the 
consent of the vessel’s master or facility manager a nd are cordial.  In some situations, 
however, IOs may encou nter significant hostility.  If any IO believes that th ey or any 
other Marine Safety personnel will be in jeopa rdy in any way, they should discontinue 
the on-scene investigation until appropriate s teps to ensure safety have been taken.   
To enlist full command s upport for the Safety and Occupation al Heath program, 
each district and comman d is authorized to  develo p controls (safe work practices)

TO WITNESSESsuited to the unit’s specific needs en compassing, but not limited to, all on-scene 
activities con ducted by I Os. 
D.ENFORCEMENT STANCE AND RELATIONSHIP TO RESPONSE ACTIVITIES DURING A MARINE 
INVESTIGATION
Generally sp eaking, marine casualty i nvestig ations that uncover criminal activity do 
not change the process b y which mari ne investigations are cond ucted.  The s ame 
findings o f fact are collected and evidence is gathered.  Specific issues that come up 
when poten tial criminal activity is detected are cover ed below.  From a respon se 
stance, mari ne casualty i nvestigations are secondar y to the savi ng of life at sea, 
protection of property, and pr otection of the marine environment.  An investigation 
should never supersede or impinge upon search and rescue or pollution response 
activities, but must be carr ied on concu rrently.  Many investigation activities, 
particularly those for pollution investigat ion, are integrated and required parts of 
pollution response.  Further, many investigat ion activities (such as securing the scene 
of the incident or directing drug and al cohol testing) are time-critical, and mu st 
receive the appropriate priority during a pollution response or search and res cue 
operation.  IOs should ensure that th eir time-critical needs are included in the 
standard incident respons e protocols. 
Various industry represen tatives and la wyers have a lleged that th e Coast Gua rd 
attemp ts to l ull mariners and other maritime personnel into a false sense of security 
with words to the effect of “this is not a criminal inquiry,” or “This is just an 
investigation for cause.”  Such statem ents are misleading and shall be avoided. 
Under no circumstances should an IO “cut a deal” with crewm embers or their 
attorneys to gain assistance.  Similarly,  Coast Guar d personnel must not make any 
representatio n as to a pos sible grant of immunity.  Only certain Departmen t of 
Justice (DOJ ) personnel can grant immunity.  Only the District Commander  can 
decide whether to refer a case for criminal prosecution. 
D.3.NO 
PRESUMPTION OF 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
D.4.QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE PURPOSE 
OF AN 
INVESTIGATIONIOs shall bear in mind that one of the purposes outlined in 46 USC 6301  is to 
determine “whether th ere is evidence that a crimi nal act under  the laws of the United 
States has been committed, so that the matter ma y be referred to appropriate 
authorities for prosecution.”  It is im portant  to stress that Coast Guard investigators 
should not begin its investigation with a presumption one way or  the other as to 
criminal acts. 
IOs should cite the specific authority that they are acting under (sometimes s everal) 
when asked as to the pur poses of an invest igation.  If asked about the possi bility of 
criminal liability by a witness or involved person before or during a interview, the IO 
should respond with wor ds to the effect that  “the Coast Guard  is free to choose civil, 
criminal, or administrative enforcemen t when an ap parent violation is detected, and 
any decision to take one type of action does not preclude another type of acti on.”

QUESTIONSIn general, in vestigations under this vo lume that h ave an associ ated criminal
investigation shall be kept open and shall not  be released eith er internally or to the 
public until such time as the District C ommander a nd criminal prosecutors give 
clearance to close and release the case.   
Because an I O cannot know at the outset whether evidence of criminal act will be 
encountered in any given case (unless the cr iminal act is evident, such as murder), 
IOs must pursue all investigations with such techn iques and practices as gu arantee 
that evidence collected and facts uncovered will not taint any future criminal 
prosecution.  This applies in all cases, re gardless of the Coast Guard’s initial reason 
for investigation.  The procedures outlined in Part B of this vol ume for fact-finding 
will assist in protecting evidence for such purposes.   
Response personnel arriving at the scene of a Marine Casualty i nvolving an actual or 
potential env ironmental incident shou ld consider that crewm embers face a n unusual 
situation.  On one hand, if crewmembers provide full cooperation and information to 
Coast Guard  personnel, any statements they make could be used in potential criminal, 
civil or administrative proceedings.  On the oth er hand, failure  to cooperate in the 
response cou ld expose their employer to potenti al civil penalties, or loss of de fenses 
or limits of liability in civil cases. 
IOs must recognize that the situation faced by the crew does not in any way a ffect 
the Coast Guard’s responsibility to respond (including gainin g cooperation of the 
crew to assis t) and/or to fully investigate th e incident and tak e appropriate a ction.   
The investigation should only be delayed in order to best meet i mmediate response 
concerns The investigation should not be suspended or delayed because of the crew’s 
situation.   
If an individual requests that an attorn ey be presen t prior to answering any questions 
during a response, Coast Guard personnel s hould contact their  servicing SJA office. 
The IO should advise the witness tha t they are free to consult th eir own attor ney on 
matters prior to giving testimony.  Wherever  possible, a mutual ly agreed upon time 
and place offering reasonable opportu nity to consu lt with an attorney should be 
arranged.  Such delay for consultation should be reasonable given the read y 
availability of attorneys. 
If the circumstances des cribed above o ccur on-scene, this does not mean th e Coast 
Guard must stop asking reluctant crew members f or assistance or stop asking 
questions.  IOs may continue asking questi ons of reluctant crewmembers j ust as they 
would a coo perative crewmember.  However, IOs should not single out, harass or 
badger reluctant crewm embers.  Further,  any attempt to en courage a reluctant 
crewmember to participate in a response or investigation should not be in the form 
of a threat of subsequent prosecution or other acti on.

INTERFERENCE 
DURING THE 
INVESTIGATIONThe Coast G uard can direct attorn eys not to interfere with resp onse or investigative 
efforts in accordance with  18 USC 1505 and 18 USC 1512.  However: 
    1.  Attorneys canno t be prevented f rom advising their client(s ), and Miranda warnings are not normally required durin g marine casualty investigations.  
Miranda warnings are only required when a suspect is in custody and subject to 
interrogation.  Courts have routinely held that routi ne Coast Gu ard boardings 
(including marine casualty investigations) are not custodial, thus Miranda does not 
apply .  The servicing L egal Office shoul d be contacted for further gui dance as 
to when Miranda warnings are required.   Also see Chapter 3 of the U.S. Coast 
Guard Maritime Law Enforcement M anual, COMDTINST M16247 .1 (seri es).  
Before interrogating a witness in a custodial situation, IOs shall administer Miranda 
Warnings and scrupulously observe th e witnesses’ r ight to counsel. 
Reluctant witnesses may be subpoenaed to  give testimony at a ti me and place 
convenient to the IO.  Such subpoenas should be issued, however, only when the IO 
and the Com mand are wil ling to enforce such subp oenas.  See S ection F below for 
more information. 
When the I O believes that an individual is inappropriately asserting a Fifth 
Amendment protection for testimony, the IO  should contact the servicing Legal 
Office.  Although highly unusual, when the situation warrants the use of resources, an 
order may be sought from the federal d istrict court directing the person to tes tify.  
Similarly, when appropriate, DOJ may grant immunity thereby voiding Fifth 
Amendment protection is sues.   
A crewm ember or attorney who fails to prov ide information or assistance should not 
be considered to be obstr ucting justice.  However, if field personnel feel a situation is 
rising to the level of obstruction of justice,  conta ct the servicing Legal Office  prior to 
taking any action.   
    2.  The Investigating officer should  consult their  servicing legal office concerning     
appropriate measures for controlling the investigation. 
D.17.ATTORNEY 
DEMANDS TO BE 
PRESENT DURING 
INTERVIEW OF NON-
CLIENTSIn general, exclusion of any person including an attorney is ina ppropriate.  Members 
of the press and public may in general be  excluded from all or a portion of an 
interview wh en: 
The IO reas onably expects the witn ess to act as an  informant pursuant to 46 USC 
3315; or 
The IO has s pecific and documented evid ence that the person is disrupting the 
course of the investigation (i.e., exclusion is necessary to mainta in control of the 
investigation). 
The IO may avoid any co nflict with witness interviews by condu cting them at a Coast 
Guard facility rather than  on-scene. 
 D.18.APPROACH 
TO ATTORNEYS ON -
SCENE DURING 
MARINE CASUALTY 
INVESTIGATIONSIn the event an attorney is already on board  and has advised his or her client not to 
speak to the Coast Guard  when IO arrives,  the following actions should be taken: 
Obtain the n ame of the a ttorney. 
Ask the attorney for the identity of cr ewmemb ers, employees o r corporations he or 
she is representing.  Try to verify that the client agr ees to this representation.
Sometimes, a company may dispatch  an attorn ey to the scene who claims to represent 
the compa ny and the en tire crew.  Such joint representation ma y be a conflict of 
interest.  Where the inves tigating officer id entifies a potential conflict, they should 
contact their  servicing legal office for assist ance before discussing the matter with the 
attorney. 
Inform the attorney of the provisions of Coast Guard responsibilities durin g
responses and investigations as above. 
Call the servicing Legal Office if an attorney representing the o ne crewmem ber or the 
company demands to be present during  interviews with other crewmemb ers. 
The Coast G uard may no t remove an attorney fro m the scen e unless he or she is 
physically impeding the response. 
E.SUBPOENAS
E.1.  General One of the most powerful tools that an Investigating Officer ( IO) has is the 
subpoena.  Subpoena authority is granted under various statutes .  They are as  follows: 
33 USC 1227   (Waterfront Facility Casualties) 
33 USC 1321   (Pollution Incidents) 
33 USC 1907   (MARPOL Violations) 
E.1.GENERAL 43 USC 1348   (OCS Casualties) 
46 USC 6304   (Marine Casualties) 
46 USC 7705   (S&R Investigations) 
An IO can is sue a subpoena during an investigation (at any l evel except preli minary) 
provided that the auth ority for the investigation is derived from one of the a uthorities 
listed above.  An extreme example of the power of the subpoena would be a situation 
in which an IO (with exceptional reasons)  issues a subpoena to a vessel master or 
agent to pro vide access to the vessel at a reasonab le location at a specific time for 
examination by an IO.  
 E.2.14USC89
INVESTIGATIONS
E.3.SERVICE OF 
SUBPOENASE.3.a.  Compel the Appearance of a  Resp ondent or Witness to an Interview or 
Hearing 
Whenever the IO has reason to believe that  a witness or respondent will not appear 
voluntarily at the stated ti me and location of an interview or hearing, a subpoena 
should be served.  The subpoena shou ld be prepared in duplicate; the original for 
service and the duplicate copy showin g the da te an d place of service, and signature (if 
witness will sign) or fact that the original wa s delivered by certif ied mail, with return 
receipt signed by the add ressee only.  The duplicate copy of the subpoena or certified 
mail receipt may be used in evidence if the wi tness  fails to appear.  If the subpoena is 
not served, a written sta tement shall b e provided, including information from the 
U.S. Postal Service, explaining the non-deliv ery and the reasons for failure to serve. 
E.3.b.  Service On Foreign Persons The Coast Guard is authorized to conduct investigations under its general law 
enforcement authorities (ex: security inci dents).  Coast Guard Officer, Petty Officers 
and Warrant Officers posses 14 USC 89a aut hority at all time when on boar d a vessel 
in addition to any specific authority they may h ave to investigate under the statues 
listed in paragraph E.1. 
The Coast Guard's subpoena power extends to foreign nationals within U.S. 
jurisdiction. These persons occasionally refuse  to appear or tes tify before a Marine 
Board of Investigation (Marine Board) or an IO, believing that they are not 
answerable.  In such cases , the Marine Board recorder or the IO should present all 
facts, including copies of the subpoena(s) issued, to their servicing Legal Office.  The 
servicing legal office may coordinate with Custom s and Border Patrol (CBP) to 
prevent the i ndividual’s departure from the U.S. under 8 CFR §215 .  The servicing 
legal office may also coo rdinate with the U. S. atto rney to seek a “show caus e” order 
from the cognizant federa l district court which wo uld require the individual to 
comply with the subpoena. 
E.3.c.  Compel the Production o f Evidence 
The Marine Board and IO are empo wered by 46 USC 6304  to require production of 
books, papers, documents  and any other evidence.  When such evidence is desired, a 
subpoena shall be served upon the cus todian(s) of s uch material.   The materi al should 
be described in sufficient detail as to b e readily iden tifiable.

E.5.FORCE 
PROTECTION WHILE 
SERVING SUBPOENASOftentimes there is a question of personal safety while service subpoenas in person.  
When in-person service is necessary (i nstead of cer tified mail service), force 
protection m ust always be considered.  The following is a list of force protection 
options in order of preference: 
ABOARD VESSELS: 
IOs, properly qualified and equipped IAW the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Law 
Enforcemen t Manual, COMDTINST M16247.1 (series) to ca rry firearms; 
Accomp anying armed boarding team members ; properly qualified and equipped 
IAW the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement Manual , COMDTINST 
M16247.1 (s eries); 
ASHORE: 
Accomp anying Coast Guard Investigative Service agents; and It is sometimes in the interest of the Co ast Guard to subpoena cooperative witnesses, 
as a witness under subpoena is in a more fa vorable position under the laws relating to 
the protection of witnesses.  Individuals under subpoena are usu ally less reluctant to 
give testimony detrimental to friends or relatives or in some wa y derogatory to 
themselves.  Furthermore, some private agen cies (s uch as drug testing consortiums) 
routinely require subpoenas for the production of their records, as a protecti on to 
themselves.  Additionally, some employers require a subpoena befo re they will permit 
an employee to miss work in order to testify. 
A notation o f the time an d date of service sh all be made by the serving offic er. When 
the witness a ppears, the Marine Board reco rder or IO shall endorse the original 
subpoena to show the time and place that th e witness participated to substantiate the 
claim for payment. The witness should also  complete Claim for Fees and Mileage of 
Witness, SF-1157 in order that the recorder or IO may process it for reimbursement.  
Funds for reimbursement should come from the investigation convening authority.  
In cases where the person subpoenaed  reside s far from the location of the hearing or 
the person's financial position makes the person reluctant to appear, government 
transportation requests may be issued to furnish transportation. [NOTE: Although a 
subpoena can be enforced judicially only with in the jurisdiction of the federal district 
court, payments for witnesses' travel b eyond the li mits of the judicial district are not
prohibited.] 
Accomp anying other federal, state, or local law enforcement ag ents. 
 E.6.ENFORCEMENT 
OF SUBPOENASWhen serving a subpoena, the IO should ensure that a reasonable request is made 
and the pers on has a reas onable period of time to comply.  When an IO is 
conducting the investigation and when no enforcement action is ongoing, the IO 
should contact the servici ng Legal Office if a subpoena is ignored.  The legal officer 
may seek enf orcement of the subpoena through the cognizant f ederal district court.    
E.7.SUBPOENA 
CONSISTENCY
F.1.INTERNAL 
AND EXTERNAL 
REFERRALSWhen referring a case to or requesting in ternal assistance from another Coast Guard 
unit during t he course of an investigation (e.g. CGIS assistance, over-flights, or other 
CG platforms), the reques t should be via the District Commander. 
In cases where a marine casualty or incident may ha ve been caus ed by criminal acts or 
criminal negligence, the C GIS should be cont acted  as soon as p ossible, particularly if 
the collectio n of evidence from electronic sh ipboard equipment, such as co mputers, 
GPS, LORA N, etc., is being considered.  The CGIS has special agents specia lly 
trained and equipped to conduct forensic an alysis a nd exploitation of computers and 
other electro nics media for evidentiary value. 
When referring a case or requesting assistance external to the C oast Guard d uring the 
course of an investigation (e.g. FBI, EPA, or other agencies), th e request shall be to 
Commandant (CG-545) via the District Commander.  This includes participation in 
multi-agency task forces when sharing Coast Gua rd information with other agencies 
and/or requesting assistance or offering Coast Guard action. During an S&R proceeding, the enforcement of a subpoena after the investi gation is 
directed by the Administr ative Law Judge (ALJ).  The ALJ will issue an order to 
comply, and if that order is ignored the enforcement process wi ll be the sam e as 
described above. 
All subpoenas to be issued from a unit SHALL be reviewed and released by the 
Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) or other senior-level single individual authorized 
by the Commanding Officer for consistency, regardless as to whether the su bpoena is 
being issued by the OCM I or the COTP.

F.4.b.  Interference with or by Foreign Governments In all situations in which Marine Safety pe rsonnel assist other fede ral, state or local 
agencies, the appropriate operational commander s hall ensure that Coast G uard 
personnel are cognizant of and comply with  the Coast Guard Use of Force  Policy, 
regardless of the policy of  the assisted agency.  The Coast Guar d Use of Force Policy 
can be found  in the Maritime Law Enforcement M anual, COMDTINST M16247.1 
(series). 
Marine Safety personnel should not normally undertake law enf orcement activities 
under the sole state/lo cal jurisdiction ex cept to pro vide state or local officers 
assistance so  that th ese officers may execute th eir duties. 
IOs should cultivate relati onships with State and L ocal Law En forcement Agencies in 
order to foster interagency cooperation.  A boating under the influence violation, for 
instance, is a violation of federal law as well as local and state laws.  In this ins tance, 
the interests of Marine Safety are best serv ed by th e coordinated action of the Coast 
Guard and State or local agencies. 
All investigations and referral of criminal offenses shall be cond ucted in acco rdance 
with the guidance in Part C of this volume regardless of interagency coordina tion. 
When condu cting investigations that involve the need to contact foreign 
governments, field units should request the assistance of Commandant (CG- 545) via 
the District Commander.   Commandant (CG-545) can be reached during the 
workday at (202) 372-1029, and after hours through the Coast Guard Command 
Center at (800) DAD-SAFE.  As a matter of  policy, the Coast Guard will conduct the 
appropriate level of enforcement actio n agai nst foreign vessels, companies, operators, 
etc., under U.S. law prior to referring  the matter to the flag state.
Coast Guard  personnel must never interfere wi th legitimate foreign law enforcement.  
Any communication with foreign law enforcement personnel should be reported via  
the chain of command an d may require notificatio n of the State Departm ent and/or 
activation of the Maritime Operational  Threat Resp onse (MOT R) plan in accordance 
with Append ix D of the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement Man ual, 
COMDTINST M16247.1 (series).  IOs should  exercise extreme sensitivity  when 
conducting investigations in the territo rial seas or jurisdiction of foreign countries and 
should not undertake such activities without consul ting with the appropriate servicing 
Legal Office.
 F.5.FOREIGN 
MERCHANT MARINERSF.5.a.  Foreign Merchant Mariners 
When an incident involves a foreign m erchant mari ner, the IO may find flag 
administration participati on in the investigat ion to be beneficial.  Foreign ma riners 
may be more willing to re spond to the IO’s questions when they believe their 
participation will have consequen ces in their home country.   
F.5.b.  Remedial Action against Foreign Merchant Mariners 
The Coast G uard often lacks jurisdiction ov er the credentials o f foreign Merchant 
Mariners.  In the event th at the investi gative process uncovers evidence of 
misconduct or negligenc e on that mariner’ s part, remedial actio n alternatives are 
relatively few.  If the specific misconduct is in violation of applicable federal laws or 
regulation, the Coast Gu ard may pursue criminal prosecution or civil penalties, 
depending upon the infraction.  Negligent operati on of a vessel, for instance, carries 
both criminal and civil penalties under 46 U SC 2302 . 
F.6.NATIONAL 
TRANSPORTATION 
SAFETY BOARD 
(NTSB) If, as in many cases, the misconduct or ne gligence carries no penalty under U.S. law 
or was com mitted outsi de of the United States’ j urisdiction, the IO should take any 
enforcement action legally available (if any) and ref er the matter  to the flag state via 
the District Commander  and Commandant (CG-545). 
Both the Co ast Guard an d the NTSB have jurisdiction to investigate major marine 
casualties.  In an effort to objectively di stinguish which agency should have lead 
during the investigation of a major marine  casualty,  the Coast G uard created a tool 
called the “b rightline.”  The brightline d etermines how much a nd how recent was the 
last Coast Guard contact/control over a vessel involved in a casualty.  When it is 
determined that there was  sufficient Coast Gu ard contact within  a recent tim e period, 
the NTSB will generally take lead in the inve stigation.  The brigh tline is used solely by 
Commandan t (CG-545) while consulting with  NTSB about a major marine casualty.  
Units are not to undertak e direct notification of NTSB or calculation/use of the 
brightline.   Commandant (CG-545) will coor dinate contact wi th NTSB for all issues.  
A unit shall never contact NTSB directl y without authorizatio n from Commandant 
(CG-545). 
F.7.DEPARTMENT

MANAGEMENT SERVICE 
(MMS) F.7.a.  Coast Guard and MMS Responsibilities 
Both the Co ast Guard an d the DOI's Minera ls Management Service (MMS) (formerly 
the Conservation Division, U.S. Geological Survey) have jurisdiction to investigate 
casualties occurring on structures on the Outer Co ntinental Shelf (OCS). The 
CG/MMS Memorandum of Unders tanding (MOU) of 30 Sep tember 2004, and the 
regulations governing OCS policy ( 33 CFR 140-147 ), provide guidance for 
conducting investigations of this nature. 
 F.7.b.  Investigative Lead 
Investigations should be conducted so as to avoid a duplication of effort. However, 
the Coast Guard and MMS have differing respon sibilities. A Coast Guard report is 
required for those incidents meeting the requirements of 33 CFR 140.201 , 33 CFR 
146.3 0 or 33 CFR 146.303 .  If the casualty is one in which MMS is the lead ag ency, 
the Coast G uard report may indicate that th e caus e of this casualty is being 
investigated by the MMS.

referral, the completed Commandant's A ction will constitute authority for such 
referral.  If, for any reason, referral to  the U.S. attorney cannot await Commandant 
review of the casualty rep ort, verbal authority may be requested  from Commandant 
(CG-545).  A U.S. attorney is not precl uded from initiating actio n without formal 
Coast Guard  referral.  When evidence of criminal liability is also within the 
cognizance o f other agencies such as th e Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), state, 
or local law enforcement agencies, such evid ence may be refer red to that a gency in a 
timely mann er without a pproval of the Command ant, however  District app roval is 
still required. 
Upon DOJ accepting the referral and going to  a grand jury, an IO may requ est that 
the U.S. Atto rney place th em on the “6 (e) list.”  This is an excep tion to the G eneral 
Rule of Secrecy regarding grand jury material under the rules of criminal procedure.  
If a person is allowed on the 6(e) list, they must not share grand jury information with 
anyone else who is not on that list.  Contact the servicing Legal Office with any 
questions regarding the 6(e) list. 
The Coast G uard entered into an MOU with the FBI on March 23, 1979 for the 
purposes of counteractin g terrorist activiti es in the marine environment.  A second 
MOU was signed on August 20, 1980 expanding the cooperativ e effort between the 
Coast Guard  and the FBI to cover all violations of federal law on the high seas, 
navigable waters, and area s adjacent to th e navigable waters.  The MOU anticipates 
that cooperation between the two  agencies will be made at the District level.  If an 
activity inves tigated by th e Coast Gua rd appears to  have a potential for FBI 
involvement, the IO shou ld contact th e servicing Legal Office.

(ATF) The MOU states tha t because the Coa st Guard and  FBI have differing areas of 
expertise, cooperation is often a better solution than having one agency take lead.  
Additionally, the FBI does not have th e authority to board vessels without a  warrant, 
while the Co ast Guard do es.  The FBI’s mandate authorizes them to investigate all 
federal criminal violations that have not been specifically assigned by Congress to 
another federal agency. 
The Coast Guard entered into an MOU with ATF on April 26, 2002, for the purpose 
of providin g investigative expertise with regard to fires and explosions on Coast 
Guard facilities, involve Coast Guard pers onnel, under investigation by the Coast 
Guard pursuant to 46 USC 6301 for whic h the Coast Guard requests ATF assistance, 
and under investigation by the ATF pur suant to 18 USC 846 for which the ATF 
request Coast Guard assistance.  ATF may pr ovide investigators, lab analysis, fire

F.11.DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE (DOD) F.11.a.  Coordination – General 
The procedu res in this section shall be applied in cases of U.S. public vessels involved 
in a reportable marine cas ualty (see 46 CFR 4.05-1 ) with a merch ant or recrea tional 
vessel of the U.S. or a fo reign vessel operating in navigable U.S. waters. 
F.11.b.  Navy and MSC Vessels 
F.11.c.  Contract Operated United States Naval Ship (USN S) Vessels When vessels of the U.S. Navy, including Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels, 
are involved, the Judge Advocate Gen eral's Corps officer of the  naval district in 
which the ca sualty occurr ed shall be a dvised.  When vessels of the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers (USACE) or  another governmental department are involved, the district 
Army engineer or appropriate command shall be advised. The participation of 
appropriate witnesses sh all be requested; if this request is denied, Command ant (CG-
545) shall be advised immediately. The investigation shall proceed without these 
witnesses, in accordance with the pro cedures set f orth in this chapter. [NO TE: As 
provided by 46 CFR 4. 11-1, military personnel and civil service employees serving 
aboard vessels controlled by the Army or Navy may not be subp oenaed to ap pear as 
witnesses in an investigation without the consent o f the governmental agency 
concerned. 
Under a July 29, 2004 MOU with Commander, MSC, the Coast Guard will 
investigate all reported marine casualti es (see 46 C FR 4.05-1) involving contract-
operated USNS vessels, except in specific ca ses wh en the MSC requests that there be 
no investigation.  When a casualty inv estigation is conducted, MSC will assist the 
Coast Guard  to the exten t practicable in th e investigation and in obtaining necessary 
witnesses.  Civil service a nd military ma nned vessels and their masters/commanding 
 officers will not report marine casualties to  the Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard 
will not investigate such casualties ex cept when specifically requested by the 
Commander MSC.  When requested not to inve stigate, the Officer in Charge, Marine 
Inspection (OCMI) should advise Commandant (CG-545) by message or other 
appropriate means. [NOTE: This policy does not affect the Co ast Guard's p olicy to 
investigate casualties when a USNS vessel is involved in a casua lty with another vessel 
over which the Coast Gu ard has jurisdiction.] 
F.11.d.  Disciplinary Action 
The Coast G uard has authority to tak e disciplinary action under 46 USC Cha pter 77
against MMCs held by a ny civil service or contract crewmemb er signed on vessels of 
the MSC, when possession of a valid license  of seaman's document issued by the 
Coast Guard  is a condition of employment.

ADMINISTRATION 
(OSHA) F.12.a.  Shipyard and Harbor Worker Accidents 
Under 33 US C 941 , the Secretary of Labor conducts investigations of accidents and 
deaths involving employees covered by that A ct.  This investigative authority parallels 
that of the C oast Guard u nder 46 U.S.C. 6301. [NOTE: See 46 CFR 4.01-3  for the 
reporting exclusion with respect to d eaths of  shipyard or harbor workers.]  Whenever 
a casualty o ccurs involving shipyard or harbor workers that is no t the result o f a 
shipboard operation con ducted by sh ip’s personnel, the casual ty falls under OSHA 
jurisdiction and OSHA should be notified for investigation. 
F.12.b.  Outer Continental Shelf Activity Accidents 
The Coast Guard and OSHA signed an MOU on 19 December 1979 to establish 
procedures to increase consultation and coordination on the Outer Continental Shelf 
(OCS). Speci fically, Sections IV-B(2) and (3) of the MOU, entitled “Investigation of 
Accidents” a nd “Investigation of Allegations” state respectivel y that in a ccordance 
with regulations issued under its authority,  the Coast Guard wi ll investigate deaths, 
injuries, and other casualties or accide nts occurring as a result of operations 
conducted p ursuant to th e OCS Act. I n the course of all such investigations, formal 
and informal, the Coast Guard will cooperate with OSHA with respect to i dentifying 
violations of applicable OSHA regulations related to the casualty or accident.  Where 
a Coast Guar d investigation identifies an a pparent violation of an applicable OSHA 
regulation, the Coast Guard will notify OS HA and subsequentl y will cooperate with 
OSHA with respect to a ny enforcement a ction OS HA may und ertake.  The Coast 
Guard will review any allegation from any pers on of the existence of a violation of an 
occupational  safety or health regulation or other unsafe working condition on the 
OCS and tak e appropriate action und er the circu mstances.

The IMO adopted resolution A.849(20) which contains the Cod e, and has revoked 
Resolutions A.173 (ES.IV), A.440(IX), and A.637(16).  The United States s trongly 
supports Resolution A.849 (20) and the Code.  The Coast Guar d will implement the 
code to th e maximum extent possible under its existing legal and regulatory 
authorities. Commercial diving accidents involving insp ected vessels and platforms are explicitly 
under the sole investigative jurisdiction of the Coast Guard.  While OSHA 
cooperation and involvement may be useful and even desired, such assistance is 
without legal jurisdiction and entirely at th e discretion of the IO or Marine Board.  
SCUBA acci dents of passengers who were transpo rted aboard inspected p assenger 
vessels shall not be consi dered comm ercial diving accidents. 
Commercial diving from platforms other than insp ected vessels  fall under OSHA 
jurisdiction.  While the C oast Guard retains overlapping authority to investi gate these 
incidents, such duplication of effort is generally unnecessary and not desirable.  
Accordingly, the IO shall coordinate cl osely with O SHA representatives regarding 
these inciden ts, and shall undertake an  independent investigation only when OSHA 
or similar state agency intent no investigation of their own. 
G.THE IMOCODE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF MARINE CASUALTIES AND INCIDENTS
Many international conventions such as the International Convention for the Safety 
of Life at Sea, 1974 (SO LAS), the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 
(ILLC); and the Internati onal Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 
1973 (MARPOL) require flag states to investigate marine casualties.  The 
international  community has increasingly become a ware of the benefits of 
cooperating in casualty investigations give n the international nature of shipping and 
the fact th at flag-state interests  often overlap port-state intere sts.  As a result, a series 
of International Maritime Organization (IMO) resolutions have addressed 
international  cooperation in increasing de pth resulting in valuable cooperativ e
investigations over the last several year s. 
The Code provides a systematic appro ach to investigations and enhances the existing 
cooperation frameworks.  Drawing on th e experience of these cooperative 
investigations, and recognizing the opportunity to i mprove safety through 
information sharing, the IMO member  states devel oped the Co de for the 
Investigation of Marine C asualties and Incidents.

Commandan t (CG-545).  Commandan t (CG-545) can be reach ed during the workday 
at (202) 372-1029, and aft er hours through the Headquarters Command Center at 
(800) DAD-SAFE. 
G.6.IO
RESPONSIBILITIESIOs should use the Code procedures to the maxim um extent p ossible in all marine 
casualty investigations in which the U. S. is an SIS. IMO Resolution A.849 (20) provides a m echanism for cooperation between member 
states during investigations along with common-approach investigative procedures.  
Enabling the Lead Investigating State (LIS) as well as Substantia lly Interested  States 
(SISs) to participate in an accident inve stigation promotes maxi mum cooper ation.  
The commo n-approach procedures define the purposes of casualty investigations and 
provide a list of information to be gathered, meth ods for securing physical evidence, 
and procedu res for authenticating documents, reviewing voyage data record ers, and 
obtaining information from other sources.  These p rocedures ha ve been inco rporated 
into this volume.  Also see Navigatio n and Vessel  Inspection Circular ( NVIC 5-98 ). 
Upon notification, member states may fu lfill their obligations to conduct an 
investigation by participating fully in the investigation of another SIS.  When  member 
states elect to participate in an investigat ion, they will select an LIS.  The LIS devises 
the strategy of the investigation, governs the investi gative proceedings, ensures the 
laws of the investigating state are obs erved during the investigation, is custodian of 
interview records and other evidence, prep ares the Report of Investigation (ROI) 
including the views of SISs, and provides reasonabl e logistical support. 
In the event that SISs elect to conduct th eir own independent investigations after 
receiving notification of a marine casu alty, the vari ous investigations should follow 
the Code an d its procedures, should share evidence, and should be coordinated to 
avoid conflicting demands on witness es and access  to evidence.
Upon completion of an investigation (wheth er independent or joint), SISs s hould 
share drafts of their ROI at the earliest opportunity.  Final versions of the ROIs 
should reflect the input received from the other SISs.  When SISs cannot agree 
regarding all or part of the ROI, they are free to submit their o wn reports to the 
IMO.  The minimum co ntents of an ROI ca n be f ound in secti on 14 of Enclosure (1) 
to NVIC 5-98 and have been substanti vely integrated into Chap ter A6 of this 
volume.

I.2.  
Information to 
be Included in 
Merchant 
Mariner’s 
Record At a minimu m, as a part of the Suspension and Revocation (S&R) process the 
following information should be entered into the MMLD data system regarding a 
merchant mariner’s record:  
A Complaint has been iss ued against a mariner’s MMC; 
A Letter of Warning (LOW) issued and accep ted by a mariner ;IOs shall not become inv olved in labor/management conflicts.  If a contractual 
infraction did not affect the safety of the passengers, crew, vessel, marine 
environment, or national security, then a ction agai nst MMCs or other remedial action 
should not normally be taken.  This policy requires OCMIs and their department 
heads to rem ember that C oast Guard Officers should not place themselves i n roles as 
labor/management arbitr ators.  See 46 CFR 5.71 ; Appeal Decision 2470 (G iachetti). 
Labor and management p ractices can create la tent unsafe conditions that ultimately 
result in an accident, inci dent, or violation.  Accor dingly, issues between lab or and 
management are frequently legitimate areas to  explore during m arine investigation.  
IOs must investigate wor k/rest sched ules and the possibility of fatigue. 
Although such investigations are undertaken  by other agencies, the Coast G uard does 
not conduct investigations to document disa bilities, labor conditions, etc., for use in 
disability litigation or workman’s compensation claim settlemen t.  When such issues 
are present, parties to the investigation may attem pt to use th e investigation as a 
vehicle to “discover” information and docu ments u seful for these purposes.  The IO 
shall retain control of the investigation and assure that only evi dence and testimony 
relevant to the purposes of the investigation are explored and examined. 
I.MERCHANT MARINER’S RECORD/WANTED LIST
In the past, I Os have taken administrative action against an MMC that was 
documented in the Marine Safety Informat ion System (MSIS) and often never looked 
at again.  As a result, oftentimes, ma riners would have their MMC suspended or 
revoked in one OCMI zone, only to have  it reissued in another OCMI zone.  
Additionally, very few administrative acti ons (i.e. letters of war ning, suspensions, 
revocations, etc.) against a mariner’s MMC were ever documen ted in the M erchant 
Mariner Lice nse & Document (MMLD) data system.  In other situations, IOs have 
receive notification of non-credentialed  mariners who failed pre-employmen t, 
random, or other mandated drug tests, but because the mariners did not hold an 
MMC against which admi nistrative action could be taken, there was limited 
documenta tion and no information entered in MMLD or shared between O CMI 
zones.  As a result, a non-credentialed ma riner who had failed a drug test could later 
apply and receive a MMC from an OCMI without the OCMI knowing about the 
failed drug test.  With the new Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement 
(MISLE) data system the Coast Gu ard has corrected this situation. 
 A Voluntary Surrender made by a ma riner (equivalent to Revocation);  
A Voluntary Deposit mad e by a mariner; or 
An S&R outcome where a sanction is imposed. 
Notification to the Na tional Maritime Center (NM C) should be made via th e notify 
NMC function within th e MISLE enforcem ent a ctivity opened to document the 
enforcement action taken  against the mari ner’s Merchant Mariner’s Credential 
(MMC).  For additional information see Chapter C 4 of this volume. 
Additionally, a new recor d in the MMLD data system should be created for a non-
credentialed mariner who has failed a pre- employment, random, or other mandated 
drug test documenting th e failed drug test since it can be reason ably inferred that th e 
mariner may apply for an MMC in the future. 
I.3.  Reasons 
for Locking or 
Unlocking a 
Merchant 
Mariner’s 
Record A merchan t mariner’s record should be locked in MMLD data system for th e 
following rea sons: 
Whenever an S&R outcome is Revocation; 
Whenever a n S&R outcome is Revocation Stayed (drug settlem ent);  
Whenever an S&R outcome is Outright Suspension; 
Whenever there is a “Good Faith” Deposit; 
Whenever there is a Volu ntary Deposi t; 
Whenever th ere is Voluntary Surrender;  
Whenever a non-credentialed mariner has failed a mandated dr ug test; and 
Whenever a merchant mariner is placed on the Wanted List. 
I.4.  Placing 
Merchant 
Mariners on 
the Wanted 
List Formerly, there were two  lists that a merchant m ariner could be placed upo n in 
MSIS.  Thes e were the Seaman Wanted List and the Seaman Locator List.  The 
reason for the two separa te lists was to  distinguish the difference between needing to 
find the mariner during th e investigation versus the enforcement process.  In MISLE, 
this list is known simply as the Wanted  List.  Curre ntly, the reas ons for placing a 
person on th e Wanted Lis t are listed b elow: 
Wanted for purposes of an investigation; 
Wanted to d eliver civil penalty corresp ondence; 
Wanted for pending enforcement a ction; Notification to the NMC of a failed drug tes t by a non-credentialed mariner shall be 
made via the notify NMC function within the MISLE Notification created to 
document th e receipt of the results of the failed drug test. 
Merchant mariner’s records shall not be locked by IOs for any other reason without 
the permission of Commandant (CG- 545).  When the reason for locking a m erchant 
mariner’s record is resolved, the recor d should be unlocked (i.e. administrative 
clemency is granted, mariner has served the suspen sion, mariner completed 
settlemen t conditions, etc.).  For additional information see Ch apter C4 of this 
volume.   
 Wanted to deliver ALJs decision and order; and, 
Wanted to acquire an invalid or revoked MMC. 
I.5.  Sending 
Information 
to, Locking, 
and Unlocking 
a Merchant 
Mariner’s 
Record The process to send information to, lo ck, an d unlock a merchant mariner’s record is 
quite simple and should be executed i mmedi ately.  When the cr iteria set forth in 
Sections I.2., I.3., and/or I.4. are met the IO should use the notify NMC function of 
the MISLE enforcement activity open ed to docum ent the enforcement actio n taken 
against the mariner.  This is the preferred method of notification.  Alternatively, the 
IO may send  an e-mail to the NMC at the following e-mail address:   
D05-DG-NMCMML DLock , located in the Glo bal listing. 
If not notifying NMC via MISL E, the following information is required to be in the 
e-mail in this format:  
PERSONNEL ACTION:  (LAST NAME, FIRST NAME MIDDLE NAME, SSN) 
(Subject of e-mail: choo se on e of the following) MMLD INFO NOTIFICATION /
MMLD LOCK / MMLD UNLOCK 
IDENTIFICATION:  1) Merchant Mariner’s Lic ense or Document Number 
                                      2) Merchant Mariner’s MMLD Reference Number
(Reference n umber is found when you  access th e Party File via MMLD in MISLE) 
ACTIVITY NUMBER:   MISLE Enforcement Activi ty # (ma y be the Incid ent 
Investigation Activity # f or locking a record due to putting them on the Wa nted List) 
J.1.  General At times IOs  get into situations where they are unk nowingly dealing with dangerous 
persons or are unable to l ocate p ersons with regards to an investigation or 
enforcement activity.  Commandant (CG-545) has acquired access to various 
computer applications and other information resou rces that will  remedy some of 
these problems. Mariners shall not be placed on the W anted List for any other reason witho ut the 
permission of Commanda nt (CG-545).  The list is expected to gr ow and chan ge with 
the MISLE system.  Any time a marin er is placed on the Wanted List their MMLD 
file should b e locked.  Units placing mariners on the wanted list should continue 
efforts to locate mariners.   For additional  information on removing mariners from 
the wan ted list and Enforcement Acti vity status see Chapter C4 of this volume. 
REASON FOR NOTIFICATION AND/OR  OUTCOME OF 
ENFORCEMENT:   Should be one of the reasons for sending info to, locking, and 
unlocking a merchant m ariner’s record listed in Sections I.2., I.3., and I.4. 
J.INFORMATION /OTHER RESOURCES

NCIC/NLETS 
General IOs were given access to National Crime In formation Center (NCIC) and National 
Law Enforcement Teleco mmunicatio ns System (NLETS) information.  IOs are law 
enforcement officers and as such are a uthorized to conduct law enforcement 
activities.  NCIC/NLETS will better enable IOs to know with whom they are dealing 
in order to be better prepared to take appropriate law enforcem ent action.  The FBI 
oversees the use of NCIC/NLETS and ha s granted the Coast Guard acces s.  The 
Coast Guard  connection to the FBI’s NCIC /NLETS system is for official law 
enforcement support acti vities only.

USE OF 
NCIC/NLETS IOs may access NCIC/NLETS when conducting a ny incident i nvestigation other 
than a pollution incident investigation and prior to personally delivering o fficial Coast 
Guard enforcement correspondence or subpoenas.  IOs may access NCIC/ NLETS 
when an inv estigation uncovers criminal activity. The Coast Guard Investigative Service is re sponsible as the network administrator of 
NCIC/NLETS use within the Coast Guard,  which includes monitoring of use, 
quality assurance reviews,  audits, and investigations of alleged, actual or suspected 
unauthorized  or improper use of NCIC/NLETS. 
Any IO who  transfers to another unit or in ternally within their unit and is no longer 
filling the position of an IO shall request th eir access to be denied.  Any IO who does 
not meet the prerequisites and has already been given access to  NCIC/NLETS shall

It cannot be stressed eno ugh that proper training is the most i mportant as pect to 
ensuring our personnel are prepared and motivated to do the j ob.  In effort s to build 
the Marine Investigation Program core co mpetencies, prerequisites for becoming a

CG-545 is responsible for determining missi on essential training requirements for all 
Marine Investigators in order to m eet Coast Guard  and program operation al 
commitments.  Annual training fund reque sts and allocation of available training 
funds and quotas will be d etermined by the cognizant command  authority based on 
mission essential requirements and the needs of the service. 
Only CG-545 may grant a waiver to a ny certificati on or minimum standard for 
training.  Coast Guard co mmands shal l ensure that all IOs assigned for training meet 
the prerequisites for atten ding initial trai ning.  Personnel not meeting these standards 
must submit a written req uest to CG-545 via the chain of command to waive any 
minimum standard or certification as part of the initial training quota request.
In order to become certified with a specialty (e.g. casualty investigator, suspension 
and revocati on investigator, etc.), the IO must co mplete PQS and sit before a 
qualification board of other personnel that are certi fied in that specialty.  Any 
recommended changes to  the PQS should be submitted to C G-545 for consideration.

B.2.DESIGNATIONTo be considered a certified Journeym an Investigator you must have completed a 
minimum of 2 years as an Apprentice Mari ne Investigator, have attended both IOC 
and AIOC at TRACEN Yorktown an d compl eted all of the following qualifications: 
Casualty Investigator (FO), Violation Investigator (EO) and S uspension and 
Revocation I nvestigator (FN). 
B.ASSIGNMENT AND DESIGNATION
Personnel assigned to an operational billet as a Marine Investigator should already be 
familiar with marine safety laws and regu lations through training and qualifications, 
generally, as a marine inspector prior to being assigned to marine investigation duties.  
Upon assignment, IOs shall acquire a SECRET (or higher) security clearance. 
As a matter of policy, entry level (i.e. fi rst tour in Marine Safety) personnel shall not 
be assigned to marine investigator billets .  Such personnel are not adequately familiar 
enough with marine safety laws and regulations to execute m arine investigations that 
often drive changes in policy/regulation/law and are fully available to the p ublic. 
The Marine Investigations Program is considered the “graduate school” of the 
marine safety community.  Accordingly, internal rotation through a marine 
investigation billet is inappropriate; pers onnel assigned are expected to h ave had 
preliminary tours rendering such “ticket” punching unnecessary.   As with “short” 
tours, active duty military Marine Invest igators may occasionally be selected for 
reassignment within a unit or to a new unit  prior to completion of their original tour 
assignment.  Such reassignments are b ased on the needs of the command an d are 
often required to fill critic al positions within the Coast Guard.  Because of the 
enormous investment of training and expe rience required to certify as a Marine 
Investigator and to gain technical com petence, internal rotations and “short” tours 
are highly discouraged. 
Upon assign ment to an operational billet as a marine investigator, personnel shall 
receive a formal letter of designation from the com mand author izing them to 
investigate within the command’s area of  responsibility.  The designation letter 
outlines their specific duties and responsib ilities, to include any signature authority. 
The letter of designation does not mean the in dividual is ‘certified’ to condu ct marine

C.2.ISSUANCE In addition to the minim um criteria outlined in COMDINST 5512.2 the following 
requirements must be followed: 
-In order to qualify for a badge the I O must be assigned to an investigating officer 
billet and must routinely conduct mari ne casualty i nvestigations or investigations of 
credentialed merchant m ariners; 
-A badge may not be issu es without marine investigator credenti als, and vice versa; 
-Marine investigator credentials shall onl y be generated using the most current 
system; 
-A marine investigator badge and credential issued to a marine i nvestigator shall have 
matching numbers; 
-Only CG-545 authorized credentials may be  displ ayed by a marine investigator; 
-CG-545 authorized marine investigator cr edential s may not be altered in an y way. investigations and is a Marine Investigator .  Such individuals are referred to as IOs 
Personnel previously assigned, designated, trained,  and certified as Marine 
Investigators are encouraged and may subseque ntly be assigned to a second marine 
investigation tour, oftentimes as an SI O.  In such instances, no training or a dditional 
qualification is required other than area familiarization provided the individual has 
been redesignated as an I O in writing at the n ew unit. 
Reserve Marine Investigators are recruited to  fill specific billets within a unit, and are 
therefore not normally internally rotated or reassigned.  It is not, however, 
uncommon for a reserve Marine Investigator to relocate to a new area, either for 
personal reasons or as a transfer with their civilian employer.  In those instances, 
reserve Mari ne Investigators must adhere  to policy and guidance governing such 
moves conta ined in the R eserve Policy Ma nual, COMDTINST M1001.28 (s eries).   
Commandin g Officers shall coordinate transfer of reserve Mari ne Investigators to the 
extent consis tent with the Reserve Policy Manual.  Receiving commands ma y employ 
certified reserve Marine Investigators as di scussed in paragraph B.3. above.  Reserve 
personnel desiring to become Marine Investig ators must be desi gnated in writing as 
an IO and undergo all training, PQS, and certification as active duty marine 
investigators. 
Civilian Marine Investigators are hired to  fill specific positions within the Coast 
Guard.  Such civilian Marine Investigat ors are bound by the training, PQS, and 
certification discussed in this chapter, but ar e advised that they l ack the general law 
enforcement authorities granted to Coast Guard mi litary personnel above the rank of 
E-3 by statute. 
C.MARINE INVESTIGATOR BADGES AND CREDENTIALS
Policies and procedures regarding the issuance of Marine Investigator Credentials and 
Badges are contained in COMDTINST 5512.2.   
 C.3.USE
C.3.b.  Recommendations for using t he mari ne investigator badge and credentials: 
-When Liaison with other law enforcement agencies is necessary; 
-When multiple agencies are responding to an incident; 
-When acces s to a scene/ facility is necessary; 
-Prior to questioning witnesses; or 
C.4.CONTROL Sector Com manders that have more mari ne investigators meeting the minimum 
requirements than they ha ve badges may request a specific number of additional 
badges from CG-545.  The requesting aut hority mu st be the Sector Commander.  
Procurement or duplication of marine invest igator badges and credentials is strictly 
prohibited. 
C.5.SECURITY 
AND ACCOUNTABILITYC.3.a.  CG-545 will provide a leather carry ing case for every marine investigator 
badge and credential.  Marine investigator credentia ls shall always be carried in the 
provided carry case, unles s the badge i s being visibly displayed o n the investi gators 
person.  Visibly displaying the badge is only authorized while co nducting 
investigations in civilian attire.  Gener ally speaking it is not advisable to display the 
badge on the marine investigator’s person when th e Coast Gua rd is the sole agency 
responding to a specific incident. 
-When a visible Coast Guard Marine Investigator presence is required (visibly on the 
marine investigator’s person). 
Long term (more than a year) unassigned ba dges should be returned to CG -545 via 
registered or express mail in order to re move them from the unit’s inventory of 
badges.  CG-545 shall be notified of al l status chan ges with regard to marine 
investigator badges and credentials.  The r eturning of marine investigator badges shall 
be included on unit PCS departure ch eck sheets. 
A quarterly inventory of all badges shall be condu cted and m aintained at th e unit.  
Damaged or severely worn marine investig ator badges, credentials and carrying cases 
shall be sent to CG-545 vis registered  or express mail for refurbishment or 
destruction.   In addition to the requirements in COMDINST 5512.2, CG -545 shall 
be immediately notified or any lost or stolen marine investigator badges or 
credentials.  This notification shall be made within 24-hours an d may be 
accomplished via telephone at 202-372-1029.  An investigation shall be initiated in 
accordance with COMD INST M5830.1, Admini strative Investigation Manual, within 
24-hours of the incident i nvolving the lost or stolen marine investigator badges or 
credentials.  CG-545 will ensure all info rmation regarding missing badges and 
credentials is entered into  the Nation al Crime Information Center (NCIC) d atabase.  
Persons in p ossession of a lost of stolen marine investigator badge or credential will 
be detained by law enforcement personnel and prosecuted under 18 USC 701, 18 
USC 716, an d/or 18 USC  1028.

credentials or carrying cases and will be  designated as appropriate retirement 
mementos. 
D.CARRIAGE OF FIREARMS
The carriage of firearms for IOs is at th e discretion  of the Com manding Officer and 
shall be in accordance with the uniform and equip ment requirements and m aritime 
law enforcement trainin g requirements (for a boarding team m ember) found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement Manual, COMDTINST M16 247.1 
(series).  When conducting official marine investigation operations in which firearms 
will be carried, all IOs will wear the same uniform and will always travel in a 
minimum of two person teams.  More personnel may be required to ensure proper 
force protection.  See the U. S. Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement M anual 
(MLEM) for details. 
All IOs shall follow the Use of Force policy detail ed in the U. S. Coast Gua rd

An incident that meets an y of the following criteria: 
B.1.b  Public/Non-public Vessel Casualty 
A casualty involving a public vessel and a non-public vessel that meets an y of the 
following criteria: 
-Resulted in at least on e fatality. 
-Resulted in property damage initia lly estimated at $75,000 or more. 
B.1.c  Significant Marine Casualty 
A casualty th at is not a M ajor Marine Casualty but causes serious safety or 
environmental concerns, involves important safety issues, or causes substanti al media 
interest. Significant marine casualties g enerally involve the following: A.DISCRETION
All incidents reported to the Coast Guard, regardle ss of the source, will be 
investigated, however, the OCMI/COTP m ust determine on a case-by-case basis 
what investigative actions are appropriate fo r a specific case bas ed on the likely value 
to marine safety, available resources, and ri sks in a given port.  This policy does not 
limit or change OCMI/COTP authority or responsibility to determine appropriate 
actions.  For example, a minor collision  (dam age less than $25,000) of a towboat and 
a moored ca sino vessel may highlight significant safety concerns that woul d demand a 
formal investigation, or the OCMI/COTP may decide to cond uct an informal 
investigation of three deaths from a fish ing vessel sinking if the added cost and 
complexity of a formal in vestigation would not bring appreciable benefit.  In such 
cases, the us ual process of investigatin g, determining causal factors, reporting, 
entering info rmation into MISLE, and record keeping must be followed.  
B.DEFINITIONS
-Resulted in the loss of six of more lives. 
-Resulted in the loss of mechanically p ropelled vessel of 100 or more gross tons.

INTRODUCTIONAll reports of incidents must be investig ated to the extent provided for under 46 
U.S.C. 6301.  The 1995 Quality Action Team on Marine Safety Investigations 
suggested that three level s of investigat ion beyond preliminary investigation are 
necessary:  Data Collection, Informal, an d Formal.  MISLE dat a entry requirements 
for all levels of investigat ion shall be in accordance with the Inv estigations a nd 
Enforcemen t Process Guide. 
C.2.PRELIMINARY Any marine Casualty reportable under 46 CFR 4.0 5-1 but of le sser severity than a 
Significant Marine Casualty. 
-A person is known to be dead (e.g. th e body has b een recovered). 
-A person has been categorized as “presumed lost/ dead” by agencies leading the 
search and rescue efforts. 
-The circumstances of th e incident m ake recovery of a person alive unlikely. 
-The vessel is known or presumed to have been destroyed. 
-The vessel is presumed to have sunk and its locati on is unknown. 
-The vessel has sunk and its location is known, but it is unrecoverable. 
-The vessel is a constructive total loss, i.e. the vessel is so severely damaged that it is 
not financially worth reco vering and/o r repairing. 
When deter mining when an incident i s to be classi fied as a major marine ca sualty, 
public/non-public vessel casualty, or a sign ificant marine casualty initially es timated

D.1.ACTION ON 
VERIFIED INCIDENTSD.1.a.  General 
D.1.b.  External Investigative Resources whether a report is genuine, how severe th e incident is or will become, whether the 
Coast Guard  has jurisdiction, whether other ag encies or offices must be noti fied, and 
what level of Coast Guar d investigative e ffort is necessary.  As such, preliminary 
investigations have no jurisdictional boundaries until they are complete.  Once a 
preliminary investigation verifies the abov e information, the co gnizant investigative 
authority assi gns the case for investigati on as a data collection activity, informal 
investigation, or formal investigation, depending on severity and value to marine 
safety. 
Data Collection Activities  do not require any significant investigative effort, and 
usually consist only of collecting basic factual information and entering it into MISLE 
for future reference and a nalysis.  Only minimum follow-up to verify accuracy and 
completen ess would be conducted if necessary.  
Informal Investigations are less exhaustive than formal investigations, but include the 
determinatio n and reporting of the causal fa ctors of a casualty.  Generally, speaking, 
only incident investigations that inclu de a marine casualty ever  reach the level of 
informal investigation.
Formal Inve stigations are reserved for the more ser ious incidents investigated under 
46 USC Cha pter 63 from  which the most value can  be gained.  Marine Boards 
convened by the Commandant and other fo rmal investigations convened by the 
District Com mander or OCMI/COTP fit into this category.  Only incident 
investigations that includ e a marine ca sualty ever reach the level of formal 
investigation. 
D.PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS
A preliminary investigation shall be co nducted for any report of evidence of a 
reportable marine casualty as defined in 46 CFR 4.05-1 in volving a US or foreign flag 
commercial vessel.  This includes reports of casualties by state numbered commercial 
vessels (e.g.: state numb ered unispected towi ng vessels and fishing vessels) that report 
casualties under 33 CFR 173.55.   A prelimin ary investigation begins when the Coast 
Guard is informed of a specific incident or situation, usually via a notification from 
the public.  Oftentimes, a preliminary inve stigation is conducted solely over the 
telephone.  When the pr eliminary investigati on has gathered and verified sufficient 
factual information to determine the ne xt course of action, the preliminary 
investigation is considered completed.   The next course of action will be either 
nothing or the IO will recommend and/or ex ecute, as appropriate, an upgrade in the 
level of investigation with possible additional notifications. 
When a local  Memorandum of Understanding is in place, the OCMI/COTP may rely

 D.2.d.  How to notify CG-545 
During regul ar business hours, when requi red, the OCMI shall immediately notify 
CG-545 via t heir appropriate chain of command  in the most rapid means av ailable in 
one or more of the following methods: 
Phone:  (202) 372-1029 
Fax: (202) 372-1907 
After regular business hours, when required, the OCMI shall immediately notify the 
Commandant Command Center (who will notif y CG-545 if and when appropriate) 
via their appropriate chai n of comma nd in the following metho d:  
Place the call  to the Com mandant Co mmand Center Duty Officer at 800-DAD-
SAFE. 
D.2.e.  Contents of the Notification 
The notifications should contain essential information, including the names of the 
vessels involved, their official numbers, nationality, the location,  known and possible 
deaths and serious injurie s, the nature of the casual ty, potential criminal issues, and 
the MISLE incident inves tigation activity and case number.  The OCMI shall also 
indicate the type of investigation they i ntend to con duct (formal/informal) and any 
recommendations to conv ene a Marine Board of Investigation or other formal 
investigation. The notification should also  contain any requests made for assistance 
from the unit to the Dis trict Comman der, Area Co mmander, or Commanda nt.   
When the case raises issues related to th e performance Coast Guard safety functions, 
the nature of  these issues must be expl ained.  Coast Guard safety functions of 
particular note include: 
•Search and R escue Activities; 
•Marine Inspection Activities; 
•Maintenance of Aids to Navigation; and release to the NRC so there are accurate tallies. Additionally, they shall remind the 
responsible party of their obligation to repor t the discharge or release to the NRC.  
The NRC shall be notified using thei r toll-free number:  1-800-424-8802. 
Note:  All Major Marine Casualties ar e required to be reported to the Com mand

investigative obligations outlined in 46 U.S.C 6301.  Enforcemen t referrals may be 
made from a data collection activity with the excep tion of an enforcement referral 
based upon information from a marine casualty (this must be informal at a 
minimum). 
IOs will not normally designate Parties in Interest for data collection activiti es 
resulting fro m a marine casualty investigat ion without a formal request for status.  
However, IOs should solicit all involved pa rties for evidence and/or witnesses.  The 
IO should evaluate and r espond to all  requests for party in inter est status. Whether or

F.INFORMAL INVESTIGATIONS
Informal investigations are initiated when an upgrade in the lev el of investigation is 
required beyond the preliminary investigation and data collection activity but not to 
the level of a formal inves tigation.  The purpose of the informal investigation is to 
expand upon information gathered during th e preliminary investigation, discover and 
document th e facts of the incident, co nduct analysi s, draw conclusions about the 
causes of the incident, draw conclusion s as to wheth er there is evidence of offenses 
on the part of any person or organizati on, and recommend mea sures to prevent

G.2.WHEN TO 
CONDUCT A FORMAL 
INVESTIGATIONA formal investigation should be cond ucted for any casualty inv olving a U.S. or 
foreign flag commercial vessel, including state num bered comm ercial vessels, and 
meeting any of the below criteria: 
Death : 2 or more deaths.
Injury : 2 or more seriously disabling injuries or 6 or more injures which result in 
fractured bones (other than fingers, toes or  nose), loss of limbs, severe hemorrhaging, 
severe muscle, nerve tend on or internal or gan damage, or in hospitalization form 
more than 4 8 hours within 5 days of the injury. 
Vessel loss : Loss of an inspected vess el, or loss of an uninspected vessel of 500 GT 
or more. 
Property da mage : An event involving a vessel and resulting in property da mage 
exceeding $1,000,000.  The damage val ue comprises  the cost of l abor and ma terial to 
restore the property (vess els, shoreline facilit ies, pip elines, OCS facilities, etc.) to its 
original condition before the occurrence, but does n ot include da mage to natu ral 
resources of the cost of s alvage, cleaning , gas-freeing, dry-docking, or demurrage.  
Damage values should be the best esti mates availa ble immediately following the 
accident.  
Discharge : Major discharge of oil or major re lease of a hazardous substance (as 
defined in 40 CFR 300.5), or of hazardous cargoes regulated under 46 CFR 
Subchapter O, in which a vessel is the source or the cause of the discharge or release. 
Foreign Flag Exception : A formal investigation is not required for a casualty 
involving on ly a foreign flag vessel (e.g. no U.S. ves sel involved, no damage to U.S. 
property, and no injury of U.S. citizens). IO is not required to make a public no tice regarding the opening of informal 
investigations, or any formal statement for the record of the investigation.  Evidence 
and testimon y are collected in as informal a setting as possible. 
G.FORMAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Formal proceedings may be initiated b ythe OCMI (Unit Formal), the District 
Commander (District Formal), and by  the Comman dant (Marine Board of 
Investigation, also referre d to as a Marine Board).  The Unit and District Formal 
Investigations are compos ed of a single IO designated by the O CMI or District 
Commander to receive evi dence and testimony  under formal rules (an additi onal IO 
is recommen ded to act as recorder).  The duties of this IO are detailed in 46 CFR 
Part 4.07.  A Marine Board is the highest level of investigative effort and may be

G.4.DISTRICT 
FORMAL 
INVESTIGATIONG.4.a.  Introduction 
The authority to convene a District Formal Investigation is found in 46 CFR 4.07-1. 
As with the decision to convene a Ma rine Board, the decision to convene a District 
Formal Inve stigation is influenced primarily by the lessons to be derived fro m the 
casualty.  If the information to be deri ved has cons iderable regional significance, or 
indicates ves sel class problems or area s of technical importance, the District 
Commander may conven e a formal investigat ion to assure that every aspect o f the 
case is probed. Additionally, broad or intense publi c interest may warrant the 
formalities of a District Formal Investigat ion. A District Formal Investigation is 
composed of one speciall y designated Le ad Investigating Officer (LIO) as the 
presiding officer.  The District Comm ander may al so designate specialists or technical 
experts to as sist the LIO. 
G.4.b.  Designation •Promptly advising the Chair if it appear s that substantial additio nal expenses 
must be incu rred. After due consider ation by the Marine Board, CG-545 
should be fully advised. 
The LIO designated to convene a District Formal Investigation will be notified by 
message, and  subsequentl y confirmed by precept.  Designation of the LIO and 
recorder is based on the nature of the casualty and  the availability of qualified 
personnel.  An officer having broad marine  experience is selected, usually a SIO or 
CID with a s trong IO background.

topics to be covered during the course of the investigation.  An example of a precept 
letter is included in the Appendix. 
OCMIs are delegated the authority an d responsibility to direct the investigation of 
marine casualties, and to designate IOs to execute these responsibilities.  Any such 
investigations may be con ducted under  the formal rules in Title 46 CFR Part 4.07 
when the iss ues involved suggest the scrutiny of a formal proceeding, or when press 
or public interest deman d formal proceedings. 
Any marine casualty quali fied marine inve stigator designated as the LIO by the 
OCMI to conduct marin e casualty in vestigations within their Area of Resp onsibility 
(AOR) m ay conduct Unit Formal Investigations.  No additiona l or case-by-case 
designation is necessary.  The OCMI may al so desi gnate IOs or other personnel to 
assist the LIO  with con ducting the formal investigation. 
The unit’s organization manual will normally c ontain the specific duties that the IO is 
expected to execute, and thes e serve a s a precept f or Unit Formal Investigations.  
OCMIs may, when appro priate, issue a precept for  a specific investigation. 
H.CONDUCT OF FORMAL PROCEEDINGS
When an incident occurs, the investigati on into the circumstances should begin 
immediately.   When a formal investig ation seems appropriate, a preliminary 
investigation is necessary  to determin e what wi tnesses and evidence th e formal 
sessions will examine.  The use of a sufficient number of field IOs is vital in swiftly 
gathering a maximum a mount of evidence. This information serves to determine the 
general topics about which witnesses will testify and the most appropriate order of 
their appeara nce. In the case of survivors arri ving as a group, it is sometimes best to 
serve subpoenas for appearance at the unit or another suitable place for preliminary 
interviews. The preliminary investigation shall not be stopped when it appears that 
the casualty will become a “unit form al”, “d istrict formal,” or " marine board” case.  
When a presiding officer (either the Ch air or  designated IO) over formal proceedings 
is named, th e OCMI shall transfer control and direction of the preliminary 
investigation to the presi ding officer of the formal proceedings.

H.1.b.  Selection of Witnesses for Formal Proceedings 
H.1.c.  Selection of Evidence for the Formal 
Proceedings 
H.1.d.  Support of Formal Proceedings 
Prior to convening of hearings the Marine Board or IO shall be provided with all 
necessary ass istance by th e cognizant Dist rict Com mander.  Legal assistance shall be 
provided during the investigation and, if  Coast Guard personnel are called to testify, 
they shall be provided legal representa tion.  If the Marine Board or IO intends to call 
Coast Guard  personnel as witnesses, the presiding officer should obtain per mission 
from the District Comma nder.  If additiona l legal resources are necessary, th ey shall 
be provided by the Area Commander or  Maintenance and Logistics Comma nder.  
Technical as sistance from Marine Safety Center (MSC) personnel shall be provided as 
requested by the presiding officer; if nece ssary, additional assistance may be obtained 
from Office of Engineeri ng Standards,  Commanda nt (CG-521). The District 
Commander shall provide  clerical personnel to the formal proceedings for use as 
necessary. The hiring of commercia l court repo rting services will be authorized 
by the inclusion of the following paragraph in th e Commandant's precept:  During the period after the casualty bu t before the i nitiated formal proceedin gs, the 
preliminary investigation directed by the OCMI should continue.  The information 
developed d uring the preliminary investigation must be collated  and presented to the 
presiding officer of the formal proceed ings so that hearings can be convened .  Upon 
designation, control of the investigation shifts from the OCMI to the presiding 
officer.  By agreement with the OCMI, the in vestigative resources at the unit may be 
employed by the presiding officer to continue or complete th e preliminary 
investigation.  The preliminary investigation is deemed complete when the presiding 
officer has sufficient information to s chedu le witn esses, admit evidence, an d set a 
date for hearings.   
Based on the preliminary investigation and pr ior to the convenin g of formal hearings, 
the recorder or IO must develop a schedule  of witness testimo ny, along with a brief 
one-paragraph statem ent of expected testimony.  This list should be circulated to the 
Parties in Interest (if designated) for comment prio r to finalization.  The schedule of 
witnesses should be made publicly available prior to the hearings. 
As with witn esses, based on the preliminary investigation the recorder or IO should 
develop a list of evidence that th ey ho pe to enter a s exhibits into the case.  In some 
cases this will require the calling of certa in witnesses to authenticate and/or explain 
the evidence at hand.  A list of prospective evidence to be entered as exhibits, along 
with associated witnesses,  should be circulated to the Parties in Interest (if 
designated) for comment prior to finalization.   The list of evidence to be intr oduced 
need not be made publicly available prior to the hearings.

A person or organization, other than those specifically listed by statute, beco mes a 
Party in Interest only after formal designati on by the presiding officer.  The following 
may be desig nated as Parties in Interest when th ey can demonstrate a conn ection 
with the casu alty or accident under investigat ion, though this is not an exhau stive or 
exclusive listing: 
•The individual, organization, or other entity whos e conduct is u nder 
investigation.  When their conduct is at issue, this includes an owner, 
charterer, agent of such o wner or charter er, licensed officer, or holder of any 
certificate of service, or any other pers on;  
•The lawful representative of a pers on, organization, or other enti ty who 
would have been designa ted a party in  interest und er criteria (a) above, but "When deemed appropriate for the proper an d orderly functioning of this Marine 
Board of Investigation, the District Co mmander is authorized to negotiate for 
commercial court reporting services pu rsuant to 10 USC 2304(a)(4).  This 
authorizatio n satisfies the requiremen ts of USCG Procurement Regulations 11-
3.204(b)(1) for Commandant (CG-85) approval prior to negotiation of contracts for 
personal and professional services. If district funds are not available, comply with the 
Manual of Budgetary Ad ministration, COMDTINST M7100.3." 
IOs assigned at any field office remain un der the operational control of the OCMI.  
When a formal investigation is convened (as a Marine Board, District Formal, or Unit 
Formal), a preliminary investigation will always  be required.  In some cases, this will 
require expertise and man power additi onal to that provided on the Marine Board or 
by the LIO.  In such cases , the Commandant, District Command er, or Commanding 
Officer should make arrangements to deta il IOs to  the operatio nal control of the 
presiding officer.  Without such a detail, unit IOs should expect to continue the 
preliminary investigation to the extent necessary o nce the Mari ne Board an d/or IO 
have arrived on scene. 
The formal designation and inclusion of Parties in Interest is per haps the mo st 
distinctive as pect of a formal proceedi ng.  Because all parties with a stake in the 
outcome of the investigation are involved from the outset, the in vestigation develops 
better and m ore relevant information than might otherwise be p ossible. 
A party in in terest, as defined in 46 USC 6303 and 46 CFR 4.03-10, includes  any 
individual, organization, or entity tha t a Ma rine Board or IO finds to have a direct 
interest in th e investigation being conducted, as wel l as those sp ecifically listed in the 
statute.

the casualty;  
•The individual, organization, or other entity is an u nderwriter or insurer of a
party in inter est as designated under the criteria in the first or third bullet 
above, when  the underwr iter or insurer has, at the time of investigation,

potential for contributing significantly to the co mpleteness of th e 
investigation, or otherwise enhancing the safety of life an d property at sea, 
through participation as a party in inter est (e.g., a maritime labor union, pilot's 
association, standards making organizati on, or an individual or corporation 
incurring damages as a result of the ca sualty).  
People and organizations that not s tatutorily  defined as parties in interest bu t are 
designated la ter as Parties in Interest h ave no speci al rights under 46 CFR part 4 until 
such time as they are desi gnated by th e presiding officer.  Accordingly, they may not 
call or examine witnesses or offer evidence until su ch time as th ey are formally 
designated as  Parties in Interest. 
Under 46 USC 6303, a party in interes t may be rep resented by l egal counsel during 
formal proceedings.  Counsel is present to advise the party in in terest in the pursuit 
of the investigation’s purposes, and may not  act as prosecutor or defense for their 
client.  Accordingly, the presiding offic er should make it clear that he or she will 
exercise appropriate contr ol in conducting the investigation, and that evidence, 
questions, and testimony deemed irrelevant to the purposes of the investigation will 
not be allowed. A party in interest (such as a corporation) will normally be required to 
speak through a single representative.
Each designa ted party in i nterest at a fo rmal proceeding, whether conducted by a 
Marine Board or IO, shall be accorded all the rights set forth in 46 USC 6303.  
Specifically, those rights are:  to be repres ented by counsel, introduce evidence, cross-
examine witnesses, and to call witnes ses in his or her own beh alf.  These rights 
should be explained at the beginning of the investigati on and again, as necessary, 
when Parties in Interest a re designated during the course of the investigation.

role of the Parties in Interest is to serve the purposes of the investigation.  Parties in 
Interest may not use the f ormal investigation as a m eans for discovering material for 
use in civil legal proceedings or for othe r reasons.  Parties in Interest should  be 
reminded of their proper role during the preliminary meeting with the Marine Board 
or IO. 
Parties in Interest should be advised during the preliminary meeting that they may call 
only those witnesses which the Chair o r Lead Investigating Officer (LIO) deems 
relevant to the investigation.  Accordingly,  Parties in Interest should submit a list of 
witnesses an d a brief paragraph of exp ected testi mony to th e Chair or LIO for 
approval.  Similarly, subpoenas may b e issued by the Chair or LIO when necessary to 
obtain evidence or testim ony suggested by Parties in Interest an d deemed rel evant.  
When Parties in Interest attemp t to exceed the scope of the investigation, the Chair 
or LIO may order them to move on to other subjects or, in an extreme cas e, 
terminate th e party’s exa mination of a witness. 
Coast Guard  investigative proceedings, including formal proceed ings, are open to the 
public and press under Title 46 USC C hapter 63.  Requests to attend investigative 
proceedings should not normally be declined unles s the presiding officer has a 
reasonable, articulated belief that public or press attendance will undermine or limit 
the ability of investigators to obtain info rmation freely.  Witness es should be 
informed that the contents of their statem ents/interviews will be made public.  Site-
safety, as wel l as procedures for securing  the scene and collectin g evidence, usually 
dictate that the public not be allowed free access to the accident scene.   
Often, there is considerable local or nationa l interest in casualties under investigation 
by a Marine Board.  Reporters are en titled to  attend open sess ions of a Marine Board, 
as are members of the public; cooperation with  news media interests is encouraged to 
the exten t that they d o not detract fro m the decor um of the proceedings or inhibit a 
witness' willingness to testify.  Media covera ge of marine casualty investigations will 
serve to increase the publ ic's awaren ess of those co nditions and practices th at
precipitate m arine casualti es, as well as the Coast G uard.  
The presiding officer should, in consultation with the cognizant Public Affairs Office, 
prepare a brief press release.  The release should contain highlights of facts about the 
casualty kno wn to date, the commen cement tim e and location of the formal 
proceedings, and the pro cedures to b e followed by the media f or obtaining 
permission to conduct expanded medi a coverage , which involves any mann er of 
audio or video coverage.  It should also specify that media repr esentatives will be 
required to make pooling arrangements as de scribed in Sectio n B.6.i. below, and that 
 H.4.c.  Expanded Media Coverage 
H.4.d.  Requests for Expanded Media Coverage. 
A request for expanded media cover age must be submitted to  the presiding officer at 
least one day in advance of the proceeding.  All Parties in Interest  must be notified of 
such requests prior to commencemen t of the proceeding. The presiding officer may 
permit coverage without the requisite notice if extraordinary conditions esta blish that 
the necessity to give notice was not foreseeable.  All request shall include:  
•The subject, date, and tim e of the proceeding;  
•A description of the type (audio, video, or still ph otography) of expanded 
media cover age which is planned; and  
H.4.e.  Ruling on Request for Expanded Media Coverage 
When the pr esiding officer receives a request from the news m edia for expanded 
media cover age, they mu st formally rule on the request within a reasonable time prior 
to the proceeding.  Expanded media covera ge shall be presumed to be per missible 
unless the presiding officer makes a finding establishing:  
•A substantial  probability that expanded media cov erage would interfere with 
the rights of the parties to  a fair hearing;  
•A substantial  probability that expanded media cov erage would unduly detra ct 
from the solemnity, deco rum and dignity of the proceedings;  
•That a particular participant would be  more adversely affected by expanded
media cover age than wo uld be memb ers of the public in general (e.g., a very 
young child), and that the expanded m edia coverage would more adversely 
affect that pa rticipant tha n would traditional media  coverage (e. g., a witness 
who was disfigured during the marine casualty in q uestion); or  
•A violation of the guidelines or additional rules imposed by the presiding 
officer. all members of the press and public are wel come to attend the formal proceedings.  
Expanded m edia coverage is coverage of proceedings by audio or video recording, 
television or radio broadcasting, cable telev ision transmission, still or motion picture 
photography, or by any other audio or video medium of communication to the 
public.  The Coast Guard 's policy is to pe rmit expanded media coverage of marine

The following section outlines the general process to be followed by the Mar ine 
Board or IO in the condu ct of formal proceedings.  Such proceedings shall be viewed 
as an opportunity for the Coast Guard to illustrate publicly the importance of marine 
investigations and the ra mifications of such a casualty to safety, mobility, and the 
environment.

The officer on my right is [name/rank],  who is atta ched to the [unit/position].  The 
officer to his right is [name/rank] who is attached to [unit/position].  He is also 
serving as re corder. [Name/rank], [name/rank], and I will make up the composition 
of this Marin e Board of Investigation. This Marine Board will submit its report of 
findings, conclusions, and recommend ations to the Commandan t of the United 
States Coast Guard.  
Introduction of NTSB Repres entative (when applicable) 
Present at this investigation is Mr. [na me], representing the Na tional Transportation 
Safety Board.  He is seated to my left.  The Nation al Transportation Safety Board is 
also charged with the resp onsibility for the determination of cau se or probable cause 
of a major casualty under the provisions of Section 304(a)(1)(E) of the Independent 
Safety Board Act of 1974.  For this reas on the Nati onal Transportation Safety Board 
representativ e will participate fully in this investigation and may make 
recommendations about the scope of the investigation, may call and examine 
witnesses, an d may submi t or request a dditional evidence.  
Public and Press Participation 
I would like to request the cooperation of  all persons present to minimize any 
disruptive influence on the proceedin gs in general and on the witnesses in pa rticular. 
Smoking will be prohibited.  Photogra phy, including television cameras, will only be 
permitted du ring this opening statement an d during recess periods.  The members of 
the press are,  of course, welcome, and an ar ea has b een set aside for your use during 
the proceedi ngs.  All cameras shall be removed from the room following this 
statem ent.  The news med ia may questi on witnesses  concerning the testimon y that 
they have given after I ha ve released them.  I ask that such interviews be conducted 
outside this room.  
Purposes of the Investigation 
This investigation is inten ded to determine the cause of the cas ualty to th e extent 
possible and the responsibility thereof, subj ect to final review and approval by the 
[Commandant/District Commander/ OCMI], and to obtain information for the 
purpose of preventing or reducing the effects  of similar casualties in the future.  This 
investigation is also intended to determine if there is evidence that any inco mpetence, 
misconduct, unskillfu llness, or willfu l violat ion of the law on the part of any licensed 
officer, pilot, seaman, em ployee, owner,  or agent of such owner of any vessel 
involved or any inspector,  officer of the Coa st Gua rd, or other officer or employee of 
the United S tates, or any other person, caused or contributed to the cause o f this 
casualty; or if there is evidence th at any act in violation of any of the provisions of the 
 United States Code or any of the regulations issued there under was commi tted.  
[This Marine Board is/I am] also empower ed to recognize any commendabl e actions 
by persons involved, and to make appropriate recommendations in this regard. 
Parties in Interest 
A person may be designated as a “party in interest” by reason of his or her position 
or part in the casualty.  They are not n ecessarily suspected of wr ongdoing. Parties in 
Interest are those who, under the existing fa cts or because of their position, may, in 
any way, be responsible for or have contri buted to the casualty.  A person is named a 
party in inter est so that they may have an  opportunity to protect themselves if facts 
develop that are adverse in nature to them .  A party in interest may be na med during 
the course of this investigation if it appears that he or she may, in any way, h ave been 
responsible for or may have contributed to the cau se of the cas ualty.  I may designate 
additional Parties in Interest if, during the course of the investigation, such 
designation is necessary and appropriate.  
All Parties in Interest hav e a statutory righ t to be present, to be represented by 
counsel, to cross-examine, and to have witnesses ca lled in their behalf.  Witnesses 
who are not designated as  Parties in Inter est ma y be assisted by counsel for the 
purpose of advising them concerning th eir rights; however, such counsels are not 
permitted to examine or cross-examine othe r witnes ses or otherwise particip ate.  
I have designated the following individuals and firms as Parties in Interest:  [list all 
Parties in Interest] 
Testimony under Oath 
[The Marine Board / I] will place all wi tnesses under oath.  When testifying under 
oath, a witness is subject to the Federal  laws and penalties for perjury for making false 
statem ents u nder 18 USC 1001. Penalties included a fine up to $250,000, or 
imprisonment up to 5 years, or both. 
Call for Assistance 
The sources of information into which this investigation will inquire are many and 
varied.  The investigative resources of the Coast G uard have made attempts  to locate 
every available piece of evidence havin ga pertinent bearing on the casualty.  
[This Marine Board/I] will hear all such evid ence.  Should any person have or believe 
he or she has  information not brought forward but which might be of direct 
significance, that person i s urged to bring that information to m y atten tion.  
Recognition of Lives L ost (if appli cable) 
At this time I would like to ask that al l of you stand for a moment of silence in 
 respect to th ose persons who have been lost as a r esult of this casualty.  
(All present stand.) 
I.3.MARINE 
BOARD AND 
INVESTIGATING 
OFFICER OATHS /
AFFIRMATIONImmediately following the Opening Statemen t, all members of the Marine Board or 
the IO (and court reporter if applicable) shall take the following oath on the r ecord: 
(NOTE:  The words "so help me Go d" are omitted  when an af firmation is given.)  
I.4.RECEIVING 
TESTIMONYI.4.a.  Exclusion of Witnesses 
I.4.b.  Appearances 
I.4.c.  Oaths for Interpreters 
When a witn ess requires an interpreter, the interpreter must be placed under  oath 
prior to placing the witness under oath or  examining the witness.  Every interpreter 
employed du ring an investigation shall be sworn in or affirmed using the following 
oath/affirmation:  
I.4.d.  Oaths for Witnesses 
Before giving testimony, witnesses sh all be required to stand while the oath or 
affirmation is administered, after which th e witness  may sit down.  The recorder or This concludes the openi ng statemen t.  Thank you for your attention.  [The Marine 
Board/I] will now take the oath, after whic h I will give the representatives of the 
media an opportunity to ask me a few que stions.  Following a t en-minute recess 
[we/I] will call the first witness. 
"I [name] swear/affirm that I will faithfu lly perform all the duties incumbent upon 
me as [a member of this Marine Board of  Investigation/the designated Investigating 
Officer], and that I will examine and inquire  into the matter now before me without 
partiality [so help me God]."  
When the recorder calls the first witness, all other witnesses (wi th the exception of 
Parties in Interest) should  be excused from the room and moved to a separa te 
designated waiting area.  This waiting ar ea shall be far removed from the primary 
hearing location so that witnesses cann ot hear or be aware of an y testimon y
presented to the board. 
Prior to receiving testimony during each session of the proceedi ng, the recorder or 
IO shall call for and receive appearances by counsel for the Parties in Interest or for 
the witness es.  This may be done with a simple request made o n the record:  “At this 
time I would like to have appearances for the record.  Would counsel for Parties in 
Interest and witnesses please identify themselves?” 
"Do you, Mr./Ms. XXXX, swear/affirm that you will faithfully  perform the duties of 
interpreter in this investigation [so hel p you God]? "
 LIO shall administer the following oath/affirmation:  
I.4.e.  Use of Subpoenas 
I.4.f.  Refusal of Witnesses to Testify 
I.4.g.  Preliminary Questions 
The cooperation and memory of a witness can bes t be served by making the person 
feel at ease.  Often when questioning is pr olonged or the witnes s is very nervous, a 
short recess will ease the witness' appr ehensi on.  The witness should be treated in a 
firm but courteous mann er.  All questions should be delivered firmly and clearly, and 
an adequate answer shall be insisted upon before proceeding to the next question. 
Generally, the following information should be obtained from a witness:  
•Name and h ome address of the witnes s.  
•Whether or not the witn ess, when designa ted a pa rty in interes t, has counsel.  
•Information from the witness' docum ent or licens e.  
•The witness' age and experience.  Expe rience includes how long the witness 
had been sail ing prior to the casualty, the position held at the tim e of the 
casualty, and  the length o f employment in that po sition on the vessel 
involved.  
•Witness status onboard the vessel if a crewmember, where the witness was 
and how he was occupied at the tim e of the casual ty.  "A false statement given to an agency of the United States is pu nishable by fine 
and/or imprisonment under 18 USC 1001.  Know ing this, do you solemnly swear 
that the testimony you ar e about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth, [so help you God?]"  
In all instances, Marine Boards and other formal in vestigations shall be convened 
under such authority allowing the use of subpoenas.  The use of subpoenas is 
governed by the general policy in Chapter A3 of this volume.  The use of subpoenas 
to assure attendance of wi tnesses, even wh en deemed cooperati ve, is encouraged but 
is at the discr etion of the presiding officer. 
As with all in vestigations, persons may el ect not to give testimon y, and nothin g in 
existing law supersedes or contravenes  the Fifth Amendment.  Accordingly, witnesses 
may refuse to testify during formal proceedings, but the witn ess’s intent to do so 
should have been well understood by me ans of the preliminary investigation.  
Accordingly, witnesses who will take the Fifth Amendment protection and r efuse to 
testify should be placed before the Marine  Board during formal proceedings only for 
the purpose of putting their refusal to testify into the record.  As with any 
investigation wherein a witness refuses the testify, the Chair or Lead Investigating 
Officer (LIO) may pursue legal action to compel testimony as d escribed in Chapter 
A3 of this volume in consultation with  their servicing District Legal Office. 
 •A subjective statem ent of the circumstances  that resulted in the casualty.  The 
witness shou ld not be interrupted during this statement.  Notes  should be 
made upon which to bas e specific questions after completion of the 
statem ent.  
I.4.h.  Order of Questioning 
I.4.i.  Concluding the Testimony 
I.4.j.  Recall of Witnesses 
If a witness is recalled, the witness sha ll be informed:  
"You are cautioned that the oath (affirmati on) you took previously is still bin ding." 
I.5.RECEIVING 
EVIDENCEI.5.a.  General •Sufficient questions to eli cit as much information concerning the casualty as 
the witness can supply. 
Direct exami nation should continue u ntil the Marine Board or LIO is satisfied.  After 
direct exami nation, coun sel for the witne ss is then permitted to ask questions, 
followed by counsel for other Parties in Interest. The investigative body may raise 
subsequent q uestions at a ny time.  The investigative body should be guided by the 
investigation process outlined in Part B of this volume. 
It is always a dvisable, before concluding an interview, to ask th e witness for any 
information concerning the casualty that has not b een elicited.  In view of the Coast 
Guard's many missions, the investigation should thoroughly cover, if applicable, port 
and environmental safety, VTS, SAR, and ATON elements in a ddition to ba sic 
requirements of 46 USC 6301.  Objections by attor neys may so metimes req uire 
deliberation by the investigative body.  When this occurs, the investigative body shall 
go off the record.  The witnesses shall be reminded  that th e Boa rd may recall  them if 
needed. 
The presiding officer may enter exhibits into the record at any ti me.  Not all evidence 
identified or received during the course of  a preliminary investigation need b e or 
should be received as evidence during formal proceedings.  Instead, the presiding 
officer should carefully limit the evidence presented to those items deemed to be 
relevant and informative.  When evidence is proposed by Parties in Interest, the 
presiding officer must no te on the record their decision regarding the receiving of 
that evidence.  The presiding officer may d ecline to enter a piece of evidence into the 
record when they do not f ind the evidence relevant or pertinent.  When a piece of 
evidence is received from the Coast Guard, it will b e marked for identification as 
discussed in Chapter B3, section F.  Evidence recei ved as an ex hibit will be assigned a 
sequential ex hibit number (1, 2, 3, etc.) for evidence obtained by the Coast G uard, 
and a sequen tial exhibit letter (A, B, C,  etc.) for evidence obtained by third p arty 
sources.  The recorder or IO shall maintain  a comp lete listing of exhibits along with 
 I.5.b.  Examination by the Marine Board or Lead 
Investigating Officer 
I.5.c.  Authentication 
I.5.d.  Marking of Third Party Exhibits 
The marking of exhibits is an important pa rt of th e record and therefore must be 
understood.  Evidence co llected by th e Coast Gua rd is collected and marked (for 
identification) using the processes in Chap ter B3, Section F.  Exhibits collected by 
third parties, however, have not been mark ed for the purposes of the Coast Guard 
investigation.   
Third party evidence which has not yet been entered as an exhibit should be marked 
for identification by mean s of a stamp, and should remain in the custody of the 
submitting party until received as an exhibit.  
When eviden ce is received as an exhibit, or  identified and rejected, it immediately 
goes into the custody of the presiding officer and remains in cu stody until final 
disposition is made.  If, at any time, th e exhibit is removed from the custod y of the 
presiding officer, a signed receipt shall be sub stituted therefore, inserted in th e place 
reserved for that particula r exhibit.  Exhibi ts referred to in the record of proceedings 
shall be numbered or lettered by th e reporter at th e time of ma rking for 
identification, or marking for identification and receipt into evidence.  They s hall be 
marked as follows:  descriptions of each exhibit for the record. 
In many cases, entry of a piece of physical or documentary evid ence as an exhibit will 
not be neces sary.  The evidence may b e examined by the Marine Board or LIO, who 
will identify the salient characteristics fo r the record.  A still or electronic photograph 
can then b e taken of that asp ect, and entered as an exhibit. 
When docu mentary evid ence is entered as an exhi bit, it should be identified during 
witness testi mony and au thenticated by the witness , rather than relying upon 
“hearsay” identification such as authentication by an IO.  Documentary evi dence th at 
has been authenticated sh ould be capti oned and signed by the id entifying witness. 
The recorder must compl ete auth entication of exhibits before  exhibits are forwarded 
or surrendered to the presiding officer, coun sel, or Parties in Interest.  Physical 
exhibits, such as glassware, film, or metal,  that can not be legibly and perma nently 
stamped or marked upon their surfaces, the r ecorder shall affix to each such exhibit 
an adhesive tape surface that is large enough to receive proper authentica tion and 
identification.  On exhibits consisting of bol ts, nuts, revolvers, or knives, the recorder 
shall place th e exhibit sta mp on a tag and affi x the tag to the ex hibit, preferably by 
wire.

RELATIONSHIP TO 
LAW ENFORCEMENT 
ACTIVITIESI.6.a.  General 
I.6.b.  Criminal Acts 
I.6.c.  Civil/Administrative Penalties and Suspension 
and Revocation (S&R) Proceedings A single series of numbers or letters shall be used for the entire proceedings, 
regardless of the number,  duration, or places  of the proceedings.  If exhibits in a 
particular hearing are, by direction of the presiding officer, made a part of the record 
in another proceeding, such exhibits shall be marked, stamped, recorded, and 
indexed, in regular sequence among the exhibits of the record into which th ey are 
incorporated , without da mage to the original  markings. A single series of numbers or 
letters shall b e used for all exhibits whethe r marked for identification, introduced 
without prev ious marking for identification, or marked for identification and later 
introduced a nd received.  The transcript sh all reflect the offering of exhibits to be 
marked for identification and the receipt of exhibits in evidence in the recor d.  The 
exhibit referred to in the transcript shall be stamped by the reco rder on the face of 
the exhibit in the lower right-hand corner, if  possible; otherwise, it shall be stamped 
where there i s available space on th e face of the exh ibit.  If there is no space on the 
face of the exhibit, the stamp will be placed on the back of the exhibit.  Each  page of 
the exhibit s hall be marked. 
As described  in Chapter A3 of this volume , investigations are neither admini strative 
nor criminal.  They are fa ct-finding activities directed toward determining the truth 
surrounding the circumstances or cau sal factors involved in the incident.  For this 
reason, all investigations must be con ducted in su ch fashion as to preserve the 
evidence and  analysis for use in whatever enforcement proceedings are deemed 
necessary and appropriate.  This procedur al protection applies to the conduct of 
formal investigations both during formal proceedin gs and the supporting preliminary 
investigation.  In general, because of the public nature of forma l investigations, such 
investigations shall be suspended when an investigation solely to support criminal 
prosecution is appropriate, and should not be recon vened witho ut approval of the 
Departmen t of Justice until such time th at criminal  enforcemen t proceedings are 
complete. 
When a formal investigation detects evidence of  a criminal act, that evidence shall be 
immediately forwarded to the Coast G uard Investigative Service via the cognizant 
District Commander in accordance with Part C: Enforcement, Section C.1. of this 
Manual.  The Coast Gua rd Investigative Service, in consultation  with the app ropriate 
servicing legal office, will determine a ppropriate notification of other agenci es, 
including the DOJ, as necessary.

COMMENDATIONSRecommend ations by a Marine Board or LIO for official commendations i n 
recognition of heroic, distinguished, or me ritorious acts should be made th e subject

Such commendations include, but are not limited to: 
•Gold or Silver Lifesaving Medals 
•Maritime Administration (MARAD) Awards 
•Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal 
•Merchant Marine Meritorious Service Medal 
•Letter of Commendation  or Apprecia tion to a Merchant Mariner (District

•Public Servic e Awards 
I.8.ADJOURNING 
THE PROCEEDINGS
I.9.RECONVENING 
PROCEEDINGSThe investigative body s hould recommend such civil penalty, administrative penalty, 
and/or suspension and revocation action as is appropriate to the Cognizant OCMI 
and/or District Comman der.  The OCMI and District Comma nder retain a uthority 
and responsibility for the conduct of these enforcement actions. (See Part C of this 
volume.) 
The preservation of evidence for potential use  in criminal, civil and/or administrative 
enforcement proceedings is a procedural requirement of all investigations.  Formal 
investigations shall maintain an evidence lock er in a ccordance with Chapter B 3 of this 
volume such that evidence considered and/or received is available for use in 
enforcement proceedings.  Convenience copies of such evidence (where pos sible) 
should be made and retai ned for the use of the formal investigation. 
•Other commendations issued by the Department of  Homeland Security, 
Department of Transportation,  or Department of State 
When proceedings must break for any reason (including multi-day hearings), the 
presiding officer shall adjourn  the proceedings.  The word close  refers only to the end 
of hearings, after which time no further evidence or testimony will be received.  
Should the presiding offic er mistakenly rema rk that the hearing is "closed," the word 
"adjourned" should be substituted in the record.  When adjourning, the presiding 
officer should state on th e record, “These proceed ings are hereby adjourned until 
[date/time], when they will reconvene at [location].” 
When the pr oceedings reconvene after being adjourned, the presiding officer shall 
call the proceedings to order on the record:  “The proceedings will come to order.  
Present are [list Marine Board members present an d Parties in Interest present].”

Everything spoken during the proceedings must be recorded, unless the presiding 
officer directs otherwise d uring the course of the proceedings.  If the presiding 
officer says, "It will be stricken," or wo rds to that effect, those words and the 
direction to s trike them sh all remain in the record.  Only if the presiding officer 
directs those words or phrases to be expunged  shall they be left out of the tr anscript. 
If any other party says, " Off the record," the reporter shall be guided by the

INTERROGATORIESThese may b e oral or written, or a co mbinat ion of both.  Depo sitions are statemen ts 
made by a witness, and interrogatories are questions  asked of a witness unable to 
appear at a s ession of the proceedings, by parties to the proceedings.  They are 
transcribed the same way as that of th e proceedings of which they are a resul t, with 
the following exceptions:  
•The Cover Sheet deno tes that it is a d eposition of a particular witness in lieu 
of a hearing or investigation.  must be mad e for each da y of the proceedings.]
A cover sheet shall be prefixed to each  volume of the record.  The cover sheet should 
identify the case; the place, date, and ti me of the proceedings; the number of pages 
(per volume); and the Co ast Guard district and po rt where the proceedings were held. 
The cover sheet should al so be marked, near the lo wer margin, "Vol. 1 of 12," etc.  
See Figure A5-1 for an example cover sheet.   At th e end of each volume of the 
record, following all appended docum ents, a heavy blank sheet shall be added to 
protect th e record.  All transcribed pa ges of the record must be securely bou nd 
together on the left margin (book style).  When the record is long, it shall be bound in 
volumes, each not exceed ing 250 pages and termin ating at the conclusion of an 
individual witness' testimony.  Small tr anscripts may be bound with staples and 
masking tape to cover the staples.  Exhibits  should be placed in file-size envelopes 
and marked by exhibit number and titl e or a short description of the exhibit.
The hearing record is to be transcribed verbatim .  Should an error of a subs tantive 
nature be no ted in the record, the presiding officer shall make th e necessary 
correction(s) to the recor d.  This is done only if, after checking the record, it is in fact 
found to be in error.  Grammatical err ors, colloquialisms, or sla ng expressio ns used 
by a witness should be transcribed exactly as  stated by the witne ss.  Phonetic spellings 
of uncommon words may be used.  A witness who desires to ma ke correction s to a 
deposition, written interr ogatory, or sworn statem ent shall draw a line thro ugh the 
information to be corrected with a pen, so as not to make it illegible.  The witness 
then shall legibly print the new information above the lined-out information, initialing 
each correction and the b ottom of each page in the right-hand corner, to indicate th at 
he or she has  read each pa ge.  Upon completion of the transcripti on of an official 
record, deposition, written interrogatory, or sworn statem ent, it is sometimes  noted 
that a page n umber is repeated or inad vertently om itted.  Should a page number be 
repeated, th e second page of the same numb er should have the letter "a" pl aced after 
the page nu mber.  If a page number is omitted, a notation to that effect sh ould be 
placed at the bottom of the previously number ed page close to  the page nu mber (e.g., 
"(Page 126 omitted.)").  Interjections i n the record such as "hu m," "aha," "a h," 
"ahem," or "phew," are to be avoided  in the transcription of the record as they 
needlessly cl utter the record.  Howev er, the following interjections are included in the 
record as they indicate a d efinite answer: uh-huh" (meaning yes); "uh-uh" (meaning 
no); and "hu h?" (meaning  the question or answer was not heard or understood).
 •The Index contains only the page nu mbers of the testimony a nd attach ments 
thereto (if an y), and the exhibits that a re made a pa rt of the testi mony (if any). 
•The Appeara nce Page den otes that i t is a deposition  and the nam e of the 
witness(es) to be deposed.  
•The depositi ons and interrogatories do not have direct and cross -
examination, but merely a notation of whom the examination is made by.  
•Parenthetical  remarks are made when th e witness is not available to sign a 
deposition, written interr ogatory, or sworn statem ent. Should the witness b e
sailing or oth erwise unavailable for signature, the instrument can be 
completed a nd forwarded to the appr opriate requesting officer; however, 
signatures should be obtai ned if possi ble. A parenthetical notation beginning 
at the center of the page to the effect that the readi ng and signing of the 
instrument was waived, should be a dded at the end of the deposition.  
•The reporter's certificate i s altered to s how the na me of the witn ess being

PARENTHETICAL 
ENTRIESParenthetical  phrases for the marking of exhibits and excusing of witnesses shall start 
in the center of the page a nd continue to the right margin.  [NOTE:  Complete
English sentences are used in parenth etical remark s; as in "(A recess was tak en.)," 
"(There was discussion off the record.)," and "(The witness was excused)."]  There is 
a group of parenthetical remarks that r arely, if ever, occur in transcripts.  It consists 
of a word or phrase immediately following  a transcribed senten ce but within  a 
paragraph.  The most frequent words in this group are "(Laughter)" and 
"(Applause)."  The first letter is capitalized so that the parenthetical remark will be set 
off more obviously from the main bo dy of the sen tence.  The p articipants in
proceedings routinely han d each oth er docu ments without the need for parenthetical 
remarks. Either they say on the recor d that they are handing something to another, or 
the handing is of no concern to the reader.  However, there are two occasions when a 
parenthetical remark is necessary when  something is handed from one perso n to the 
other.

marked the photograph.  The reporter should never presume in a parenthetical 
remark to specify any hei ght or distance a witn ess may have in dicated, the manner in 
which a witn ess may have demonstrated, or the part of an exhibit that m ay have been 
marked.  If a witness says,  "It hurt me here," no parenthetical remark should be 
added.  An attorney or the presiding officer will so metimes add the comment, 
"Indicating the left shoulder," or "Indicating the head."  Even i f no one makes a 
comment on  the record to clarify a vague answer, the reporter should not make 
presumptions.  An error on the repor ter's part may be an influence on one of the 
parties concerned, with no way of cor recting the er ror later.  There is no need for the 
parenthetical remark "(Interrupting)" in a reporter's  transcript.  When one s peaker is 
interrupted by another in mid-sentence, a dash shal l be put at th e end of the 
interrupted remark.  Also, there is no n eed for the p arenthetical remark 
"(Continuing)" in the reporter's transcript .  [NOTE:  A dash is also used to note a 
change of thought in mid-sentence of the person s peaking.]  Likewise, there is no 
need for the parenthetical remark "(Readin g)" in a transcript.  The quotation marks 
that surround a direct qu ote make it a bsolutely clear that something is being read, and 
the marks are far less cumbersome than "(Readin g). "

K.CLOSING THE PROCEEDINGS
The closing of formal proceedings does not concl ude the inves tigation; instead it 
marks only the end of the public participat ion in the investigation.  Contact with 
Parties in Interest can and  should continue after the formal proceedings have been 
closed. 
The presiding officer should deliver a summary closing statement detailing the course 
of the formal proceedings.  Such closing statemen t should not include concl usions of 
fact or causes, and must avoid the appearan ce of bl ame apporti onment.  In general, 
the closing statemen t sho uld mirror the opening sta tement. 
The recorder or LIO shall draft an ROI in accordan ce with Chap ter A6 of this 
volume.  The ROI shall contain the information developed using the investigative 
processes described in Part B of this volume.  The printed ROI and associated 
MISLE data shall serve as the public record of the investigation. 
The ROI shall be developed using MISLE.  Accordingly, the recorder or LIO must 
enter all data  regarding the incident required by MISLE, and the entire record of the 
investigation should be held within MISLE.   No separate report should be generated. 
The ROI must be approved by the co nvening authority.  For a Marine Board, the 
case is forwarded by the Chair to CG-545  for revi ew and approval.  For Di strict and 
Unit Formal Investigations, the LIO forwards the case to the O CMI or District 
Commander for review and approval .  When a case contains safety 
recommendations, final approval of the case rests with the high est entity in the chain 
of command  to which the recommend ations are ad dressed. 
Documentary evidence p roduced in accord ance with 46 CFR 4.05-15(a) or 4.09-5 
should be reproduced or read into the record and then returned  to the own er.  For 
protection at a later date, the recorder should note (off the record) when, where, and 
to whom evi dentiary material is returned.  Real evidence such a s items of equipment,

INVESTIGATIONdebris, life preservers, etc., may be received or  exhibited in evidence if relevant to an 
issue in the investigation.  Body wounds or scars may also be displayed.  Real
evidence sho uld be clearly and accurately described in the tes timony.  Where p ossible, 
real evidence should be reduced to ph otographs, lab reports, etc., and the original 
pieces return ed to their o wners.  The resulting documents shou ld then be m arked as 
exhibits and made part of  the record.  Photographs of material conditions constitute 
a highly valuable form of evidence, provided they are not susceptible to 
misinterpretation.  Photographs should be id entified as to what they portray, with the 
date, place, and the photo grapher's name.  If the witness is asked to draw a s ketch, it 
should be drawn off the record.  This has been found beneficial because a witness, in 
making a sketch, will often mumble to himsel f or say aloud things that are out of 
context and which are no nsensical in the record.  When the wi tness has finished, the 
chairperson shall return to the record, ask the witn ess to explain what was d rawn, and 
have the witness sign and date the sk etch.  [NOT E:  Whenever possible, one color 
should be used to draw or mark exhib its.  If various colors are used, adequate 
differentiation between colors (e.g., "red is dotted l ine,” "green is dashed line"), must 
be provided so that later black and white reproduction of the document wi ll be 
understanda ble.]  It is imperative that the witness es clearly and concisely refer to the 
exhibit in an exact manner in order to prod uce a m eaningful record.  For example, if 
a compartm ent in an exhibit is marked "Compartm ent A," th e witness shou ld refer to 
it as such, rather than "thi s" or "that" compartment.   Also blow-ups of exhibits 
should be used to facilitate convenient  reading and access by all parties. 
Unless otherwise directed , exhibits shall be tr ansmitted at th e same time as the record 
of proceedings, whether in the same v olume or in separate volu mes.  If any exhibits 
are not attached to the record (i.e., too large or classified) a memorandum shall be 
inserted in th e appropriate place, giving th e full identification data of the exhi bit and 
stating that it is being forwarded under separate cover. 
L.NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) 
The purposes and condu ct of marine investigations by the NT SB and Coast Guard 
are compatib le and compl ementary.  Accordingly, it is accepta ble and desired that 
formal investigations and NTSB investigations cooperate and even merge.  At times, 
NTSB representatives ma y be named to and partici pate in formal Coast Gua rd 
investigations, or Coast Guard represen tatives m ay be nam ed as party to, a nd 
participate in , formal NTSB proceedings .  This section outlines the general 
relationship between the agencies and  the rules under which ea ch operates.
Upon receipt of a notification, the Coast Gu ard should initiate an investigation based 
upon the reported severity of the incident.  When a formal investigation is called for, 
on-scene IOs should pursue an active pre liminary investigation under the informal 
rules in support of the formal investigation.  This is also true in the case of casualties 
 L.3.NOTIFYING 
THE NTSB In accordance with 46 CFR 4.40-10, the OCMI must determine and inform CG-545 
in the most efficient means available if a casualty: 
•Is a major marine casualty;  
•Involves a public and a nonpublic vessel an d at least one fatality or $75,000 in 
property damage;  
•Involves a Coast Guard and a nonpublic vessel and at least one fatality or 
$75,000 in property damage; or  
•Is a major marine casualty that involves significant safety issues  (multiple 
deaths, serious hazards, etc.) relating to Coast Gua rd safety functions (search 
and rescue (SAR), aids to  navigation (ATON), ves sel traffic systems (VTS ), 
etc.).  
L.4.THE COAST 
GUARD /NTSB
RELATIONSHIPL.4.a.  NTSB-led Investigations 
In accordance with the CG/NTSB MOU and 46 CFR 4.40 -15(b), the NTSB shall 
conduct the investigation of certain major marine and public/nonpublic vessel 
casualties.  When NTSB is leading the invest igation, Parties in Interest shall not be 
designated b y the Coas t Guard.  Although these investigations are conducted by the 
NTSB in accordance with their procedures, the Coast Guard will participate f ully as a 
party. The O CMI should maintain dail y conta ct with CG-545 during the 
investigation.   Additionally, when the National Tra nsportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
is the lead in vestigating agency for an incident and the Coast G uard is not conducting 
its own formal investigation, the cognizant unit shall, at a minimum, complete an 
Incident Investigation Activity at the Data Collection level for the incident 
L.4.b.  Coast Guard-led Investigations later to be in vestigated by the NTSB.  In accordance with 46 CFR 4.40-10, the Coast 
Guard’s preliminary investigation should fi rst determine wheth er the acciden t meets 
the criteria for NTSB notification.  The OC MI shall then conti nue to direct on-scene 
investigation efforts until such time as the investigation transitions to NTSB or other 
formal control. 
Following n otification from the OCMI, CG-545 will notify NTSB.  Units shall 
not conta ct NTSB directly. 
When requested by NTSB in accordance wi th 46 CFR 4.40-25, the Coast Guard will 
conduct the investigation of major marine  casualties  and certain public/nonpublic 
vessel casualties for the NTSB.  In so me instances, the NTSB will designate a 
representativ e to participa te in every p hase of the i nvestigation, including on-site 
investigation, conducted under the provisi ons of 46 CFR 4.40-25.  Consistent with 
the Coast Guard's responsibility to direct the course of the investigation, the NTSB 
representativ e may mak e recommenda tions about the scope of the investigation, call 
and examine witnesses, a nd submit or request additional evidence.  A copy o f the 
record (i.e., the testimon y, exhibits, statements, pho tographs, etc.), of each

PARTICIPATING IN 
NTSBPROCEEDINGSL.5.a.  Introduction 
L.5.b.  Designated Parties investigation in which the NTSB participa tes, inclu ding those conducted by Marine 
Boards of Investigation, shall be transmi tted directly to the NT SB throughout the 
course of the investigation. 
Upon the occurrence of a major marine or a public/nonpublic vessel casualty that 
meets th e criteria of 46 CFR 4.40-15(b) , the approp riate Coast Guard com mands 
shall continue routine on-scene activities (SAR, pollution response and emerg ency 
services, succor survivors, manage traffic in the affected waterway, or accom modate 
salvage activities).  The O CMI/Captain of the Port (COTP) should take reas onable 
measures to secure the scene from sights eers and l ooters until the NTSB or Coast 
Guard marine investigators have had an opportunity to view the scene and d ocument 
the evidence.
After the NTSB investigator in charge (IIC) has had an opportunity to determine the 
central issues of the accident, the various pa rties participating in the investigation may 
be assigned to groups, each responsible for gathering certain facts.  The nu mber of 
NTSB investigators assigned and the number of investigative groups formed 
generally will depend upon the severity of th e casualty.  In many cases, there will be 
only one "group."  The NTSB prefers that individuals possessing various skills, such 
as experienced investigators or technicians, be assigned to assist parties with in the 
assigned groups.  The Coast Guard wi ll always  be designated as  a party and, as such, 
will provide personnel to participate in investigative groups.  The OCMI will 
normally appoint at least one IO to partic ipate in witness interviews.  When s everal 
groups are formed to investigate a sev ere casualty, the Comman dant or District 
Commander will appoint an individual to  serve as Coast Guard liaison with the 
NTSB team.  Additional personnel may be designated to partici pate in the 
investigative groups.  Such personnel should have some training and experience in 
the subject matter to b e investigated by the group.  Examples of groups that may b e
proposed include weather, witnesses, structu res, recorded communications, course 
recorder, operations, engineering, and human factors.  NTSB procedures require that 
each group shall be led by an NTSB investigator.  Under the direction of the group 
chairperson, each group will perf orm the task(s) assigned to it. 
Under the N TSB rules, those persons, agencies, co mpanies, and  associations whose 
participation  in the hearin g is deemed necessary in the public interest and whose 
special knowledge will contribute to the development of pertinent evidence are 
designated parties. A party to an NTSB investigation is normally a marine 
organization or agency th at can aid in de veloping the facts of th e casualty.  
Individuals n ormally are not designated as parties. A party under NTSB procedures is 
afforded rights similar to a party in interest. 
 L.5.c.  NTSB Hearings 
L.5.d.  Testimony By Coast Guard Personnel 
L.5.e.  Proposed Findings, Conclusions, And 
Recommendations 
L.5.f.  Effects Upon Coast Guard Actions It is likely that the NTSB will hold a form al hearing or deposition soon after the on-
scene investi gation (in approximately 2 to 6 weeks).  It is at this time that v erbatim 
testimony a nd exhibits are formally enter ed into evi dence.  As a party to th e 
investigation, the Coast Guard will provide a spokesperson; normally, this shall be the 
senior officer participating in the on-scene investigation.  The NTSB interprets the 
word spokesperson to mean "the only person allowed to talk on behalf of the party at 
the hearing."  The Coast Guard spokesperson should be prepared to ask questions of 
witnesses an d otherwise participate a nd fully represent th e Coast Guard's i nterest in 
the hearing. The policy o f the NTSB is to allow on ly one spokesperson for the 
complete for mal hearing.  Certain exceptions  have been permitted, such as where the 
subject matter concerned  two program areas.  One officer was allowed to examine 
witnesses of concern to h is program while the spokesperson questioned the o ther 
witnesses.  If exceptions a re deemed n ecessa ry, approval should be obtained from the 
IIC.  The NTSB rules in 49 CFR 84 5.13 re quire that the spokes person be a s uitably 
qualified technical emplo yee who do es not occupy a legal position.  In general, the 
spokesperson will not be an attorney. 
Since the N TSB does not exclude witnesses from the hearing during the testimony of 
other witnes ses, the Coas t Guard spokesperson should take the opportunity to 
familiarize Coast Guard witnesses with both the hearing procedure and the testimony 
of other witnesses.  Coast Guard personnel ca lled as witnesses s hall be provided legal 
counsel. 
At the concl usion of the NTSB proceed ings, each party has the opportunity to 
submit proposed findings of fact, conclusions, and recommend ations.  The Coast 
Guard spokesperson shall prepare and submit proposed findings of fact, conclusions, 
and recomm endations setting forth the Coast Gua rd's positions on the casu alty, and 
the evidence developed by the investigation.  A copy of all proposed findings of fact, 
conclusions, and recomm endations sh all be submitted to CG-545 and to the District 
Commander in whose district the inves tigation is held.
Should information gathered during th e preliminary or NTSB in vestigation indicate 
that civil or criminal penalty proceedin gs, S&R proceedings under 46 USC Chapter 
77, or court-martial proceedings under th e Uniform Code of Military Justice are 
warranted, an appropriate investigation must proceed independ ently of NTSB 
activities.  Such action sha ll not be held in abeyance pending the NTSB report.  Coast 
Guard personnel participating in the NTSB investigation shall not be assigned to 
conduct UC MJ investigations.  However, evidence developed d uring the course of an 
NTSB investigation may be used to document  a report of violation or for discovery 
 L.6.ACTION ON 
NTSBREPORTSpurposes in S&R proceedings.  
For those casualties investigated by N TSB, a copy of the NTSB report of 
investigation will be reviewed by CG- 545 to determine what action, if any, shall be 
taken with respect to the NTSB's safety  recommendations.  This report will be 
retained by CG-545.  The Coast Guard spokesperson involved in NTSB-le d 
investigations shall complete th e MISLE data en try requirements for the casualty.  
The report and the original of Coast Guard required forms such as the Barge 
Addendum, CG-2692A should be forwarded to CG-545 via the cognizant OCMI and 
District Commander.

INVESTIGATION 
(ROI) The Report of Investiga tion (ROI) i ncludes the narrative document consi sting of 
findings of fact, analysis, conclusions, recommendations, the CG-2692A as 
completed a nd corrected  by the IO, a nd all endorsements by th e Commandi ng 
Officer, Sector Comman der, District Commander,  and Comma ndant.  The ROI does 
not include the evidence. ROIs are required in all formal investigations, but are 
optional in informal inve stigations and data collection activities.  When no R OI has 
been crea ted, the MISLE incident inves tigation activity serves as the ROI.

generated as a result of conducting the inve stigation.  At a minimum, the IO s hould 
maintain the following in the correspo ndence recor d: 
•Letters generated by the Coast Guard  relevant to the investigation while open; 
•Letters from parties in interest relevan t to the inves tigation while open; 
•Letter from 3rd parties relevant to the investigation while open; and

B.1.REQUIREMENT 
FOR MISLEA.OFFICIAL RECORD OF THE INVESTIGATION
The Official Record  of an investigation is the MISLE incident investigation activity, 
which includes the Repor t of Investigation (when r equired), and all evidence 
including testimony, statements, the p recept (for formals), the CG-2692A form(s), 
attachments,  any substitu te originals and the corres pondence record . 
__________________________________________________________________ 
The Incide nt Investigati on Activity means the referential and incident-specific data 
contained by MISLE.  The Incident Inve stigation Activity ma y contain the R OI, 
correspondence records, all evidence including testimony, statements, the CG-2692A 
form(s), atta chments, any substitute or iginals or subset thereof.   
•All correspondence related to appeals.   
Substitute Original  means a photog raph or some other medi um can be u sed as a 
replacemen t for a piece of physical evidence, where the original is no longer required. 
During the course of an investigation, an enormou s amount of notes, reminders, 
internal memorandum, etc., not forming a substantive part o f the record of the 
investigative proceedings can accrue.  These notes and internal documents a re not
part of the o fficial record, and must be properly disposed of prior to final agency 
action.

INVESTIGATION 
ACTIVITIES AND 
ROISIn general, reviewers shall assure: 
•All relevant matters of fact have been explored 
•All relevant matters of fact have been  adequately d ocumented, depending on 
the level of investigation designated (data collection, informal, formal). 
•All findings of fact in matters of contr oversy are justified 
•All conclusions are in reference to documented findings of fact and their 
analyses 
•All conclusions are logically consistent with the findings of fact a nd their 
analyses marine casua lty –reportab le or not, criminal offense, etc) from the public.  In all 
cases, the IO will conduct a preliminary investigation, whether that preliminary 
investigation ultimately results in a verified incident or not.  This information will be 
used for comprehensive managemen t of the Marine Safety Program.  
For data collection activities and informal investigations, responsibility for preparing 
the MISLE incident inves tigation activity resides with the lead I O.  Review remains 
the responsibility of the Commanding Officer, w ho is the owner of the report.  
Where appropriate, the Commanding Officer may delegate the responsibility of 
reviewing MISLE incident investigation activi ties to other seni or personnel.  Keep in 
mind that all  casualty rep orts, data, an d analysis submitted by C G-545 to the IMO are 
derived from  MISLE.  As such, IOs shall follow the current MISLE process guides 
when entering incident investigations into MISLE and all units shall ensure the 
appropriate level of review is conducted on MISLE incident investigation activities 
upon their completion.  It is highly recommended that all incid ent investigation 
activities, including pollution investigations, be reviewed by the SIO.   
For Unit and  District Formal investigations, responsibility for preparing the MISLE 
incident investigation acti vity resides with  the desi gnated presiding officer.  Review 
remains the r esponsibility of the Commanding Officer/ District Commander , who is 
the owner of  the report.  Where appropriate, the C ommanding Officer may delegate 
the responsibility of revie wing MISLE  incident investigation activities to other senior 
personnel.  
For Marine Boards of In vestigation, res ponsibility for preparing the MISLE incident 
investigation activity resides with the r ecorder.  Review is the responsibility of the 
Chair and CG-545, who is the owner of the report.  The Commandant may delegate 
this responsibility as appropriate. 
 •Causes have been adequately anal yzed, depending on the case type 
•Human error has been do cumented an d analyzed, d epending on the case type 
•All evidence of violation has been referred for appropriate enforcement 
action 
•All recommendations are in reference to conclusions 
•All recommendations add ress conditions observed and are supp orted in the 
case file.

OF INVESTIGATIVE 
RECORDSAll incident investigation activities shal l have the co mplete recor d scanned in to 
MISLE.  The unit shall maintain all or iginal records in accordance with th e 
Information and Life Cycle Management Manual, COMDTINST M5212.12A 
(series). 
C.2.RETENTION 
OF RECORDS OF 
HISTORICAL VALUEThe Coast G uard retains records of historical value for 100 years after final agency 
action is taken.  Historical records incl ude but are n ot limited to the following: 
•Reports of Marine Boards of Investigation 
D.1.GENERAL•All data entr y is in accordance with cu rrent MISLE process guides. 
ROIs are required for any formal inves tigation.  ROIs need not be prepared for 
informal investigations or data collection a ctivities.  IOs should consider preparing an 
ROI when they feel it would more fully explain the complexiti es of the incident, or 
when frequent public or press scrutiny of the incident is likely.  In such cases , the 
ROI shall be deemed th e same as th e ROI for a fo rmal investigation. 
Depending on the party taking agency a ction, the Commandin g Officer, District 
Commander,  and Comma ndant may endorse an ROI.  When such endorsements take 
place, they s hall be integrated into th e final version of the ROI, and therefore 
supersede previous unendorsed versions. 
C.RETENTION OF INVESTIGATIVE RECORDS
Any materials that cannot be scanned by the unit s hould be sent to Commandant 
(CG-5453) to be added to the record. 
Investigations into Major and Medium Oil or HAZMAT discharges. 
D.FORMAT AND TEMPLATE FOR REPORTS OF INVESTIGATION
ROIs are not required or desired for all in vestigations.  In those instances wh ere a 
substantial investigative effort has been  made, however, an ROI often serves as the 
most readabl e documenta tion of our findings.  Accordingly, IOs are encoura ged to 
 D.2.MANDATORY 
STRUCTURED.2.a.  Required Structure 
All ROIs should follow the same basi c structure: 
•Executive Summary and/or Incident Brief 
•Action by th e Command ant (wh ere appropriate) 
•Action by th e District Co mmander (where appropriate) 
•Action by th e Commandi ng Officer/Sector Comm ander (where appropriate) 
•Subject(s) of the investigation 
•Findings of fact 
•Causal Analysis  
•Human Error Analysis  
•Conclusions 
•Enforcemen t Referrals (where appro priate) 
•Safety alerts (where appr opriate) 
D.3.STYLE OF 
WRITING
D.4.USE OF 
PICTURES,
DIAGRAMS, AND 
TABLESmake use of ROIs wherever they will add value. 
•Safety recom mendations
ROIs are formal, agency action docu ments dealin g in many ca ses with hum an tragedy 
and significant environmental damage.  Accordingly, IOs are ad vised to maintain a 
highly profes sional and impartial tone.  Speculation is discouraged, as is any informal 
or conversational style of writing.  Each ROI is prepared for the convening 
authority’s endorsement and public promulgation. 
Any means o f conveying complex information simply and eas ily is encouraged.  
Accordingly, IOs are encouraged to ta ke full advantage of modern electronic 
document pr oduction capabilities to include photographs, diagra ms, tables, and the 
like in the body of the R OI.

B.2.REASONS TO 
RE-OPEN,
RECONSIDER, OR 
REVISEWhile each si tuation must be evaluated  on its own merits, the following are general 
reasons to reopen an investigation or revise the ROI: 
•There are overt errors of fact in the R OI. 
•There is reason to believe that evidence was presen ted to th e IO but not 
evaluated in the ROI. Final Action is Taken By :

B.REOPENING AN INVESTIGATION ,RECONSIDERING AND 
REVISING THE ROI 
As with all s uch public requests for a formal decision, a person wishing to have the 
Coast Guard  reopen an investigation, reconsider, or revise an ROI should detail their 
request in writing to the C oast Guard entity taking a gency action.   The request 
should, at a minimum, be timely, expl ain the reaso ns why the C oast Guard s hould 
reopen, reconsider, or re vise, and must prov ide sufficient material in way of evidence, 
etc., to allow the Coast G uard to fully evaluate th e line of argument.  A request to 
reopen an in vestigation because new evidence has emerged, for instance, sh ould 
include descriptions of that evidence s o that th e Coast Guard can evaluate the 
situation.  A timely reques t is one that, if granted, will likely result  in a meaningful 
improvement to the inves tigation process as applied to the parti cular investigation, 
findings, conclusions, or safety reco mmendations contained in the ROI. 
 •Credible new evidence ha s emerged which bears directly on con clusions in 
the ROI. 
•Credible new analysis of the existing facts has em erged which bears directly 
on conclusions in the ROI. 
B.3.REASONS TO 
DECLINEAgain, each s ituation mus t be evaluated on its own merits.  The following, however, 
are general reasons to decline to reop en or revise: 
•The investigation/ ROI is so old that th e value to marine safety in revising 
the ROI does not justify the effort required to reopen or revise. 
•The points raised in the request are so  minor that the value to marine safety 
in revising the ROI does not justify th e effort requi red to reopen or revise. 
•The new evi dence submi tted is not relevant to the Coast Guard ’s findings and 
conclusions, and no new f inding or conclusion would be warranted. 
•The new evi dence is not credible. 
•The evidence was adequa tely evaluated during the original investigation. 
•The new ana lysis is not relevant to the Coast Guard ’s findings and 
conclusions. 
•The new ana lysis is not credible. 
•The analysis was adequately evaluated during the original investigation. 
•There is no evidence that parties in interest requested their parti cipatory 
rights under 46 CFR 4.07  in a timely manner. 
B.4.DECLARING 
THE INVESTIGATION 
REOPENED
B.5.RECEIVING 
INFORMATION FROM 
THE REQUEST TO 
REVISE THE REPORT•There is reason to believe that parties i n interest were denied their 
participatory rights under 46 CFR 4.07. 
•Possible criminal or civil offenses referred for adjudication ha ve been 
subsequently found not proved. 
If the Coast Guard entity that conven ed an investi gation deter mines that fu rther 
investigation is warranted  in the interest of  marine safety, that entity may reo pen an 
investigation.  An investigation is decl ared reopened  through the same mecha nisms 
that a new in vestigation is convened, wi th the precepts appropriately altered to 
include the b ody of existing evidence, analysis, findings, conclusions, and 
recommenda tions.  Generally speaking, the conveni ng authority should include in the 
precept th e specific issues to be addres sed rather th an requiring an entirely n ew 
investigation.  The investigation is reopened upon i ssuance of th ese precep ts. 
Once an inv estigation has been reopened,  the IO or Marine Board may receive 
evidence and testimony relevant to the issues for which the investigation was 
reopened.  In general, the procedures  for receiving evidence a nd testimony are the 
same as thos e for any other investigation.

be declared r eopened.  When a supplemental ROI i s issued, an entry should be made 
documenting  the fact and explaining the nature and reasons for the 
changes/revisions. 
C.HOW A PERSON FILES AN APPEAL
When a pers on wishes to  have an RO I revised, they must request it in writing to the 
Coast Guard  entity th at convened the invest igation.  The decision of that en tity on 
the request is then subject to appeal un der 46 CFR 1.03.  Appeals may not be filed 
without a pr eceding request to reopen  an investigation or to revise the ROI.
As a matter of policy, oral requests to revise an ROI and oral appeals of decisions 
shall not be accepted.  In this instance, the person should be informed that the Coast 
Guard will take action onl y on written requests and appeals. 
Under 46 CFR 1.03, appe als must be filed within 30 days of the decision or of the last 
administrative action on the issue at h and.  Upon written requ est, the 30 day period 
may be exten ded for good cause. 
An appeal must contain a description of the action or decision being appealed and 
the person’s reason(s) wh y the decision or acti on should be revised.  In the case of a 
ROI, it should include a copy of the d ecision at issue and any underlying evidence 
which must be evaluated.
D.RIGHT OF FURTHER APPEAL
When the Di strict Comm ander makes a decisi on on a person’s appeal of the OCMI 
decision, the District Com mander’s decisi on may in turn be appealed to the 
Commandant under 46 CFR 1.03-25.  As wi th the previous appeal, the pers on must 
follow the procedures for appeal contained in 46 CFR 1.03-15. 
A person may request the Commandant review his or her decision, but there is no 
right of further appeal of the Commandant’s decisions under 46 CFR 1.03.

INTRODUCTION
A.2.RECORDS OF 
MARINE CASUALTY 
INVESTIGATIONSBy law, the Coast Guard  must make availabl e to the public, for inspection or copying, 
investigative reports, vessel casualty reports , personal injury reports, casualty report 
transmittal letters, and records of investig ations, which are required to be pres erved 
by the Coas t Guard. 
The record of an investigation of vessel casualty made by a Marine Board or an IO 
must be mad e available at any stage of th e investigation, upon written application to 
the Chair of the Marine Board or, in ot her investigations, to the OCMI having 
jurisdiction.  Availability is contingent upon: 
That the record is in a form suitable for release.  For example:  report forms, 
messages, written sta tements, etc., are readily available.  Un-transcribed steno grapher 
notes or tapes, undeveloped film, etc., are not readily available. 
Making the materials ava ilable must not interfere with fact-gathering process. 
The material  is not exem pt from disclosure under the Freedom  of Information Act.  
(Rememb er that Marine Information for Safety and  Law Enforcement (MIS LE) 
printouts can only be released by Commandant – s ee, Freedom of Information and 
Privacy Acts Manual, COMDTINST M5260.3. 
ROIs by Marine Boards will be consider ed compl ete and may be released when 
Commandan t has taken a ction, except to the exten t they contai n information related 
to national s ecurity.   
ROIs by IOs on vessel casualties not s ubmitted  in narrative form will be considered 
complete an d may be rel eased when a ction has been taken by th e final reviewing 
authority in accordance with other p olicy. A.CONFIDENTIALITY IN MARINE INVESTIGATION
The first paragraph of Public Affairs Ma nual, COMDTINST M5728.2 states that “it 
is the policy of the United States Coa st Gu ard to make availab le to the pub lic all 
information concerning the activities of th e service except that which is restricted by 
law, and to do so in a frank, forthright and expediti ous manner.”  The manual gives 
you three go od, general rules for the release of information:  (1) if you are responsible 
for something, you can tal k about it; (2) if you are not responsible for something, 
don’t talk ab out it; (3) if you are uncertain, seek guidance before talking about it.  This 
section will provide additional, more speci fic guidance on what you can and cannot 
release during marine investigations. 
When releasi ng information to the press, remember to only release facts tha t are not 
in dispute.  An example of facts in dispute is conflicting statements regarding the time 
of the incident.  If one mariner says 0100 and another mariner says 0300, you, as the 
IO, cannot release the ti me of incident; however, you may state that the incident 
occurred in the early hours of the morning provided all factual accounts agree.

A8-2 A.3.POLLUTION,
PERSONNEL ACTION,
AND CIVIL OFFENSES 
INVESTIGATIONSPollution, pe rsonnel action, and civil offenses investigations are not open to the 
public.  If one of these in vestigations reaches th e media you may acknowledge that 
there is an o n-going investigation when  the COT P/OCMI has determined  that th ere 
is sufficient evidence to b elieve that a viol ation of law or regulations was co mmitted.  
This decision is reached when either the case is clo sed with a warning or the case is 
submitted to  a Hearing Officer or Administrative Law Judge. 
A.4.CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATIONS
A.5.RULES OF 
THUMBWhen dealin g with the pu blic or the m edia, there ar e some basic rules with regard to 
the interview and specifics on what to say.  They ar e listed belo w. 
If the situation allows, set ground rules on the interview.  Explain what information 
you can give and what yo u can’t give. 
Never specul ate or give personal opinion.  If you make a statem ent, it is alwa ys on 
the record. 
Never respond with “No comment.”  Explain briefly why you will not or cannot 
answer the q uestion.  When doing this, make sure it is a valid reason.  Some good 
responses are: 
     “I’d rather not specula te . . . let’s deal in the facts only.” 
     “That information is classified.”
     “Answering that question may jeop ardize the investigation in progress”  
B.1.
INTRODUCTIONIf an investigation is significant in scope  and expos ure, you may confirm in general 
terms that an investigation is in progress since the media will gather this information 
from private sources.  Generally, this only applies as a result of a sizable marine 
casualty or pollution response. 
All inquiries, including those from the media or th e public, regarding matters for 
which criminal prosecution is being considered, or for which referral to DOJ has 
been made, s hould be referred to the se rvicing Legal Office.  Upon receiving a 
request for information about such cases, th e servicing Legal O fficer should  consult 
with the app ropriate DO J attorneys to ensure that any information provided does not 
inadvertently violate Federal Rules of Cr iminal Procedure or co urt orders, or 
otherwise compromise ongoing investigati ons.  The same guidance applies to press 
releases abou t the cas e.  The servicing Le gal Officer should ensure that the Public 
Affairs Office is appropriately informed of restrictions on information provided 
about criminal investigations and prosecuti ons of cases in which the Coast Guard is 
involved.   
B.MECHANISMS FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION
There are m any methods  of delivering information to the publi c.  They range from 
personal interviews to news conferen ces.  They ar e all listed in COMDTINST 
M5728.2 (series), Public Affairs Man ual and COMDTINST M5260.3 (series),

A8-3 B.2.FOIA
REQUESTS
B.3.INTERVIEWS Interviews via telephone or in person are the most common form of Coast Guard 
news release.   Generally speaking, if a n incident that is being investigated is large 
enough, the media will contact the Coast Guard.   It is important to relay to the media 
the facts that are not in dispute.  This w ill ensure to the public and the media that the 
Coast Guard  is forthcoming with important information. 
C.1.
INTRODUCTION
C.2.DEATHS OR 
SERIOUS INJURY
C.3.PARTIES IN 
INTERESTFreedom of Information and Privacy Acts Manual.   The main methods tha t IOs 
encounter ar e Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests an d the interviews by 
the media. 
When a member of the public wishes information from records kept by the Coast 
Guard they must submit a FOIA request.  All Marine Casualty r ecords that a re closed 
are maintain ed and owned by Comma ndant.  FOIA request sh ould be sent directly to 
CG-5453 so they can be processed.  Casual ty reports shall not be released by field 
units. 
Conversely, there are some lesser interest investigations in which you may wish to 
contact the p ress.  Generally, you would take this course of action if you wanted to 
increase the public’s awareness of those conditions and practices  that precipitate 
marine casua lties, as well as adding to their sense o f trust and understanding about 
the operatio ns of the Coast Guard’s Marine Safety Program. 
C.TIMING OF BRIEFINGS,INTERVIEWS, AND PRESS RELEASES
There are several issues that come into pl ay when considering the timing of the 
release of information.  In this particular case the i ssues are primarily related to 
marine casua lty investigations.  There must be a ba lance between getting the 
information out and resp ect for the pr ivacy/personal issues of those involved. 
Any time the Coast Guar d is called to condu ct an i nvestigation and there is a death or 
serious injury involved, the IO on-scene should never release th e names of the 
victims.  As a courtesy to  victims’ family members, they should be the first to be 
notified prior to reading about it or seeing it on television. 
Parties in interest have certain rights throughout a marine casua lty investigation.  As a 
courtesy, up on completi on of an investigation,  the final report should not be released 
to the public until the par ties in interes t have had a chance to see it.  All briefings, 
interviews, and press releases should wait until tha t time.

investigative skill and have most positi vely influenced marine safety; and 
A.2.BACKGROUND
A.3.CORE VALUES 
AND CONCEPTSThe award evaluation criteria are built on two  core values and concepts. These values 
and concep ts are the foundation of the modern Marine Safety Program: 
•Severe incidents require exhaus tive investigative response.  Incidents 
have value to  marine safety when th ey have particularly severe consequences , 
affect many people, or are of such notori ety that th e American public must be 
assured that corrective action has been  or will be taken. We mu st fully 
investigate all such incidents. A.PROGRAM OVERVIEW
•Publicize  the "value add " of the Marine Investigations Program.
The Coast Guard’s Marine Investigations Program  has been a v ital arm of its marine 
safety activiti es since 1838 when th e program’s predecessor, the Steamboat 
Inspection Service, was established. In 18 32 alone, approximately 14% of the steam 
vessels in operation were destroyed by expl osion and over 1000 people were killed. 
These explosions happen ed largely because there were no insp ection laws o r rules of 
navigation. In some cases , mariner in competen ce, negligence, and/or misconduct 
were contrib uting hazards. The U.S. Congress reacted to these facts by establishing 
inspection laws and creati ng the Steams hip Inspection Service. Congressman James 
Sener of Virginia sponsored the legisl ation that created the mod ern Marine 
Investigation Program on June 20, 1874. Congress man Sener’s bill put in place the 
world’s most effective system for identifying and eliminating unsafe conditions in the 
marine trans portation sys tem, perhaps  the single greatest s tep fo rward known in 
marine safety. The Sener award honors and recalls his contribution to the saf ety of 
mariners, vessels, and the marine envir onment through marine investigation. 
•Superior inv estigation of inci dents buil ds a cas e for chang e. Superior 
investigation of less severe incidents can be of equal or greater value to 
marine safety when th e information in that report, combined with other 
similar reports, builds a case for change. We must pursue the case for change 
through superior investigation of incidents that rai se important safety issues ,
regardless of their conseq uence.

B.1.CRITERIA AS 
AN EVALUATION 
SYSTEM
B.2.SYSTEMS 
APPROACHThe criteria focus on the i mpact a sp ecific marine investigation had on marine safety 
generally, and on the processes involved in conducting a particular marine 
investigation that achi eved results at the highest level. All criteria directly relate to 
results and key investigative processes. 
Area and District Commanders, OCMIs and COTPs may submit applicati ons 
justifying presentation of the Sener Award for up to three mari ne investigations 
completed (closed) by their unit(s) during the preceding calendar year. Applications 
must be com pleted in accordance with  this guide and are due to CG-545 not later 
than 01 March. Applicati ons received later than 01 March will not be consid ered by 
CG-545 during that awar d cycle. Awa rds related to  particularly noteworthy 
investigations completed /closed during previous years may b e submitted with 
justification of late submission. 
CG-545 will empanel selected military an d civilian members of the Coast Guard 
deemed to h ave expertise in marine invest igation and marine sa fety generally for the 
purpose of evaluating the applications. The board shall provide to CG-545 p rioritized 
recommenda tions for the selection of three Sener Award winners. In the event that 
fewer (or no) applications meet th e criter ia for the Sener Award, the panel sha ll 
recommend that no such award be gi ven during that calendar year. 
Following th e approval of the Evaluation Panel’s selection, CG-545 will pre sent the 
Sener Award  to the Commanding Officers responsible for the selected marine 
investigations for that specific investigat ion. Team and/or personnel awards  for the 
specific investigative team involved will be considered as appropriate and forwarded 
separately. Three Sener Awards will typically be presented annually. Such awards shall 
be made in as public a forum as reasonably available. 
B.KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EVALUATION CRITERIA
The criteria guidelines below comprise an evaluati on system. T he criteria are set of 
results oriented requirements. While the evaluation panel is not s trictly bound  to a 
specific weighting of these criteria, each cr iteria must be explicitly evaluated. The 
program anticipates that the panel’s ev aluations will be returned to the originators 
and serve as a useful management tool  that goes beyond most performance reviews.
All of the criteria specified below origina te in the vi ew that s ystem accidents do not 
result from a single factor, either huma n error or mechanical failure. Complex 
systems, such as the mari time transportation system, simply possess too many proven 
defenses for a single factor to pose a significant threat in itself. Instead, majo r 
tragedies appear to result from a strange and unforeseen combi nation of events and 
factors, each occurring at exactly th e right time and  place to en able the next. 
Together, the threats buil d or synergize; ea ch single factor is necessary (the a ccident 
couldn’t hap pen without it), but insuffici ent withou t the oth ers. Thus the criteria

A.THE MARINE INVESTIGATION PROCESS
In complex systems, such  as the mariti me transportation system,  there are ma ny 
interactions between the operational p arts of the system including: mariners, 
shoreside workers, management, vessel e quipment and material,  facilities, vessel 
traffic services, navigational aids, publications, char ts, manuals, and the envir onment.  
Because of the complexity of the maritime transpo rtation system, there is th e 
constant danger that critical information w ill be overlooked or lo st during a marine 
investigation.  To avoid this, the Coast Gu ard's Marine Investigation Process, which 
is based on a nd mirrors the approach prescribed by the Interna tional Maritime 
Organization (IMO), was developed.  The step s of that process are listed in the figure 
below along with a visual representatio n of their relationship to the correspo nding 
steps in the I MO’s system atic approach.

B1-2 A.2.GENERATING 
A TIMELINE
A.3.CAUSAL 
ANALYSISAfter collecti ng all pertinent informati on and the d evelopment of the accident 
timeline, the IO conducts  Causal Anal ysis to deter mine “how a nd why” it happened.  
The process of conducting Causal Analysis ca n be thought of as occurring in several 
stages: 
•Identify the I nitiating Event, Subsequent Events, a nd the Defense Failures 
that allowed Subsequent Events to occur. 
•Identify the Unsafe Act(s )/Decision(s ), Condition(s), and Defense Failures 
that allowed the Initiating Event to occur. 
•Identify the remaining Causal Factors with regard to Unsafe 
Act(s )/Decis ion(s) and C ondition(s) in the model of production. 
A.4.HUMAN ERROR 
ANALYSISFor every unsafe act or d ecision identified in the first stage of th e causal anal ysis, the 
IO should determine th e type of hum an error involved using the GEMS process: 
•Determine whether the u nsafe act or  decision was a Planning Error or 
Execution E rror. 
•Determine the classification of Planning or Execution Error. 
A.5.CONCLUSIONS Conclusions are the results of the Causal and Human Error analysis as they r elate to 
the accid ent.  Conclusions should generally be stated in a “cause=effect” statement 
with as little ‘analysis lingo’ as possible.   Conclusions are classified as either direct or 
inferre d.  A direct conclusio n is made when the an alysis of factual information and 
associated ev idence leads to onl y one possible outcome.  An inferred conclusi on is 
made when the analysis o f factual inform ation and associated ev idence leads to one 
or more possible results and the investigator must rely on his/her or some other 
person’s professional experience and knowle dge to decide whi ch of the pos sible 
results is most likely true.   
A.6.SAFETY 
RECOMMENDATIONSThe purpose of Safety Recommendations is to propose correcti ve actions for 
identified unsafe conditions or other unwanted ou tcomes in order to prevent those Following the detection/ notification of an incident and subseq uent fact-finding, the 
timeline is used to docum ent the “who , what, when  and where” of the accident.  The 
IO should use the SHEL model as an i nterviewing and organizational tool for the 
collection of factual information regarding the human aspects of the accident that 
make up the timeline.  Once all the per tinent information has b een collected  and 
sequentially organized to give the “when” part  of the timeline, it is classified into 
actions, even ts and conditions.  These steps identify the “who, what and wh ere” part 
of the timeline.  See Cha pter B4.

B1-3 conditions from contributing to future ca sualties.  They should be based upon and 
flow logically from the timeline, caus al and huma n error analysis and conclusions of 
the investigation.  To determine whether a safety r ecommend ation is appropriate, the 
IO should ask the following questions: 
•Has the existence of a specific condition been identi fied?  
•Has that co ndition been determined to be unsafe?  
•Can control be exercised over that condition? 
•Has it been determined that controls do  not currently exist tha t adequately 
address that condition? 
Safety recom mendations must address  actual unsaf e conditions rather than 
hypothetical conditions.  Safety recom mendations may be m ade to address any unsafe 
condition identified during an accident in vestigation, including t hose that did  not 
cause nor co ntribute to the specific a ccident under investigation.  When doing so, 
IOs will need to include an explanation of the risks and probable consequences 
associated with the continued existence of th e condition, as it will not necessarily be 
evident.  Safety recom mendations should only be made to add ress those un safe 
conditions over which some level of control can be exercised through the 
implementation and use of control measures.  Control measures (a.k.a. Defenses) 
include conventions, laws , regulations, policies and procedures.  They should only be 
made to add ress unsafe conditions when one of th e following is true: 
•There are no  current control measures in place. 
•The current control meas ures are found to be inadequate.
A.7.VIOLATION 
ANALYSISSafety recom mendations should not be ma de wh en the unsafe condition was  the 
result of non-compliance with an existi ng control measure (e.g. a mariner ignored the 
prohibition against smoking during a t ransfer operation), a.k.a. A violation.  See 
Chapter B6.  Safety reco mmendation s can and sh ould be mad e regarding how to 
improve  comp liance with existing control measures.  
Violation an alysis is the isolating of facts in the tim eline as well as the huma n error 
analysis (when applicable) into the elements of a violation of law and regulation by 
any person (or sometimes, organization).  When there is evidence of a violation, 
including negligence, mis conduct, or willf ul vio lation by a mariner holding Coast 
Guard issued Merchant Mariner’s Credentials (MMC), civil penalty and/or criminal 
matters, the IO refers this evidence for appropriate enforcemen t and remedi al action 
in accordance with Part C  of this volume.  See Cha pter B5.

Detection of Incidents  
 
THIS PAGE IN TENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
 A.INTRODUCTION
A.1.ACTIVE AND 
PASSIVE DETECTIONThe Coast G uard detects incidents in one of  two ways: (1) wh en we are no tified by 
the public or other agenci es, called passive detection,  and (2) when we co nduct 
operations specifically designed to detect an incident, called active detec tion.  Both 
active and pa ssive detecti on’s are important to th e Coast Guard ’s Marine 
Investigation Program. 
A.2.TRENDS IN 
INCIDENTSBecause Coast Guard units respond to incidents on a case-by-case basis, it is easy to 
treat the in cident out of context.  When detec ting incidents, IO s should pay particular 
attention to the incident history of a vessel, organization, person, facility, or area of 
the waterway.  For instance in some ca ses, apparently unrelated unknown source 
discharges portray a tren d in an area, and may uncover a patter n of violation.  
Similarly, a repeated histo ry of acciden ts by a single company (perhaps on many 
vessels) may indicate an u nsafe condition endemic to the comp any.  Accordi ngly, IOs 
are strongly encouraged to view their detection efforts within the context o f trends of 
incidents. 
B.NOTIFICATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC
B.1.NOTICE OF 
MARINE CASUALTIESB.1.a.  Required Notice and Report 
Commercial vessel owners, agents, operators, ma sters, and persons in charge are each 
responsible under 46 CFR 4.05-1 for notifyi ng the Coast Guar d that a marine casualty 
has occurred .  Under 46 CFR 4.05-10, the same people are responsible for providing 
the Coast G uard with a written repor t (on form CG-2692 series) providing details 
about the a ccident. 
B.1.b.  Timing and Contents of Notice 
The notice o f marine casualty required by 46 CFR 4.05-1 must be given to the nearest 
Coast Guard  Marine Safety or Inspection O ffice, or Coast Guard Group Office, as 
soon as practical after ad dressing the immediate s afety concern s caused by the 
accident.  Under 46 CFR 4.05-10(b), however , a written report can serve the purpose 
of the notice if that report is filed “wit hout delay.”  Without del ay should not be 
interpreted to mean the f ive-day standard found in 46 CFR 4.05- 10(a).  If operators 
wish to submit written r eports in lieu of the required notice, su ch reports m ust be 
written and delivered quickly in order to allow the Coast Guard  to determin e
appropriate a ction.  The contents of th e noti ce are l isted in 46 CFR 4.05-5.  Note tha t
reports of hazardous con ditions (often the same conditions that cause or res ulted 
from a casualty) are requi red under 33 CFR 160.215 (See 33 CFR 160.204 fo r a 
definition of “hazardous condition”).  Also note th at the reports under 33 CFR 
160.215 may not be delaye d under 46 CFR 4.05-10(a). 
 B.1.c.  Timing and Contents of Report 
The report of marine casualty required by 46 CFR 4.05-10(a) must  be given to the 
nearest Marine Safety / I nspection Of fice within five days of the casualty.  The report 
must contain all relevant information on the CG-2692 (Report of Marine Accident, 
Death, or Injury), CG-2692A (Barge Addendum),  and CG-2692B (Report of 
Required Chemical Drug And Alcohol  Testing following a serious marine incident).  
Additional requirements related to pos t-casualty dr ug and alcohol testing information 
required in the report are listed in 46 CFR 4.05-12. 
B.1.d.  Over-reliance on Notices and Reports 
While comm ercial operators are required to report all marine casualties, IOs are 
cautioned no t to rely excl usively upon such reports in detecting incidents.  The 
commercial maritime co mmunity is composed of a variety of operations ranging from 
large companies well versed in the rules fo r reporting accidents to small one-person 
operations that may be completely unfamiliar wi th the relevant regulations and forms.  
Accordingly, IOs must not assume an  entirely pass ive stance wi th regard to detection 
of commercial vessel accidents. 
B.2.REPORTS OF 
ACCIDENTS TO AIDS 
TO NAVIGATIONUnder Title 46 CFR 4.05-20, whenever a co mmer cial vessel collides with or otherwise 
damages an aid to navigation maintai ned by the C oast Guard, the person in charge 
must report the incident to the neares t Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI).  
Such incidents may not be reportable under the rules in 46 CFR  4.05-1 because the 
resulting damage may fal l below the r eporting threshold.  In this situation, no CG-
2692 report is required, and the person in charge may fulfill his obligations merely by 
phoning in a report. 
B.3.REPORTS OF 
BOATING ACCIDENTSThe statutor y requiremen t to report recreational bo ating acciden ts is contained in 46 
U.S.C. 6101. The implem enting regulations, including the content of the rep orting 
form and submittal procedures, are in 33 CFR 17 3-174. In su mmary, the owner or 
operator of a boat or vessel involved in a boating casualty or accident shall report the 
casualty or a ccident to a s tate reportin g authority or, if no approved state reporting 
authority exists, to the C oast Guard. The report shall be made on either th e Coast 
Guard Boating Accident Report, Form CG -3865, or on a state boating acci dent 
report form.   Boating Accident investigat ions are discussed in detail in Chapter B12 
of this volu me. 
B.4.REPORTS OF 
POLLUTION 
INCIDENTSThe responsible party (RP ) must report all discharges of oil or ha zardous material to 
the National Response Center  (NRC).  On occasion, IOs or Pollution Investigators 
(PIs) receive these reports .  In such cases, the IO/PI should not assume that the 
NRC has been notified, and should request that th e RP contact the NRC directly a t 1-
800-424-8802.  When the RP is unkno wn, the IO/PI shall contact the NRC to assure 
the discharge was reported.  The NRC will pr ovide the cognizant Captain of the Port 
(COTP) with a summarization of the report. Many if not most pollution incident 
 investigations will be launched based upon notification from the NRC.  
B.5.REPORTS OF 
HAZARDOUS 
CONDITIONSUnder the rules in 33 CFR 160.215, t he owne r, agent, master, operator, or person in 
charge must report hazar dous conditions to the nearest Coast Guard Marine Safety 
Office or Group Office.  Such reports may be m ade by any m eans, and no written 
follow up report is required.  A “hazar dous condition” is define d as any condition 
that can adversely affect a vessel, bridge, structure, or shore area, or degrade the 
environmental quality of any port, harbor, or navigable waterwa y of the United States.  
Hazardous conditions can include, but are not limited to; collisions, allisions , fire, 
explosions, grounding, lea king, damage , injury or illness of a person aboard, or a 
manning shortage.  The intent of hazardo us condition reporting is to inform the 
COTP and Group Commander so that appropr iate response action can be initiated.  
Hazardous conditions may be caused by marine casualties.  Not all hazardous 
conditions, however, result from incidents that the Coast Guard will investigate.  
Accordingly, IOs must co nsider each h azardous co ndition report and decide if an 
investigation is warranted ; however, the report must be documented in the Marine 
Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) data system. 
B.6.THIRD PARTY 
REPORTSB.6.a.  Receiving Third Party Reports 
IOs receive many reports  from the public re garding maritime operations.   In general, 
IOs should direct callers a nd visitors to  complete a written witness statement.
Written statements ma y be submitted i n any form, including letter, but must identify 
the person making the report, the lo cation of the alleged offense, and the subjects 
(i.e., vessels, facilities, or people) involved.  The person filin g it must sign and date the 
report, and must understand that (to th e extent allowed by th e Privacy Act) the 
contents of the report will become a matter of pu blic record.  Under exceptional 
circumstances, IOs may document phone  conversation with a person making a 
report, and use such a do cument in lieu of a written report.  Anonymous rep orts are 
not sufficient to establish  reasonable cause for the purposes of search and s eizure, 
however they are sufficient to init iate a preliminary investigation. 
B.6.b.  Review of Third Party Reports prior to 
Investigation 
IOs should review reports thoroughly prior to proceeding beyo nd the preliminary 
investigation.  In many circumstances,  the report will not on its face contain an 
incident requiring in vestigat ion.  Refer to Chapter B 7. 
C.ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE /DETECTION OPERATIONS
C.1.
INTRODUCTIONThe Marine Investigations Program ha s historically relied on passive detecti on 
techniques.  Criminal offenses, civil offens es, and some pollution incidents, however, 
are not typically reported to the Coas t Guard by the people involved, and IOs cannot 
take a passiv e approach to detecting these in cidents.  Accordingly, activities such as 
harbor patrols, enforcement boardings, and sting operations actively search for 
 incidents the Coast Guar d would not otherwise discover. 
C.2.SURVEILLANCE 
/DETECTION 
PATROLSC.2.a.  General 
As described in Volume VI of this manu al (Ports and Waterwa ys Activities),  
Chapter 1, Coast Guard u nits conduct mult i-mission patrols in the enforcem ent of 
various laws and regulations, including the detectio n and investigation of marine 
casualties and pollution incidents. 
C.2.b.  Surveillance and Detection in Multi-mission 
Patrols 
The need for surveillance / detection i n multi-mission patrols arises from the fact that 
marine incidents continue in our ports despite our prevention activities.  Surveillance 
/ detection p atrols are aimed at detecting, mari ne incidents.  When an incid ent has 
been detected, an investigation s hould immediately be launched.
C.3.CLANDESTINE 
COLLECTIONSome incidents (particula rly criminal and civ il offenses) leave v ery little evidence.  In 
these cas es, the incident can only be d etected  and i nvestigated while it is ongoing.  
With the authorization of CG-2, it may be possible for IOs to survey maritime 
operations in plain clothes and withou t identifying themselves. However, th ese 
operations, while necess ary and effective, may create questions  on legal authorities 
and possible risk to personnel safety.  Before commencing any operations involving 
IOs in plain clothes, commands must con sult with their District response and legal 
offices and CG-2 to ensure compliance with guida nce on cland estine operations in  
MLEM Chapter 2..E.3.b.  Commands  must develop in advance a concept of 
operations plan (CONOP S) that outlines the intend ed activity li mits, personnel 
protection concerns, evidence gather ing pr ocedures, and antici pated actions  if 
violations are detected.  CONOPS should refl ect that th e purpose of the a ctivity is to 
detect ongoing violations of marine saf ety laws and  regulations and for personnel 
protection reasons should ensure that IOs do not reveal themselves or take action 
prior to uniformed Coast Guard personnel or  CGIS agents arriving at the scene.  
D.NOTIFICATION FROM OTHER COAST GUARD UNITS
D.1.
NOTIFICATIONS FROM 
THE NATIONAL 
RESPONSE CENTER The NRC relays all reports of discharge to the cognizant COTP via MISLE and a 
“flash fax.”  These electronic summaries of the discharge report should be treated by 
IOs/PIs as any other noti fication.  Because notifications are not screened for 
duplication at the NRC, u nits will often recei ve more than one notification related to 
a single incident.  In these cases, the incident will have two or more NRC report 
numbers associated with it.  Particular atten tion m ust be paid to accounting  for each 
and every N RC report (by number) so  that th e Coa st Guard can  explain how each 
report was investigated. 
D.2.
NOTIFICATION OF When aviatio n or afloat units encounter pollution, these units u sually report the 
observation to the District (m) staff and to the cog nizant COT P.  Such notifications 
 POLLUTION 
OBSERVATIONshould be treated as any other report of an incident and should be fully investigated.  
Because these units will typically be unawar e of NRC reports there may be duplicate 
notifications.  Particular attention mus t be paid to a ccounting for each and every 
notification so that th e Coast Guard can account f or how the report was in vestigated. 
D.3.SITUATION 
REPORTS 
(SITREP S) When significant aviation and/or afloat reso urces are used during search and rescue 
operations, units may rep ort their involvement an d account fo r resources by sending 
a situation report.  IOs should assure that all aviation and afloat units, groups, and 
small boat stations copy them on all SAR SITREPs.  IOs should, at a minimum, 
screen these SITREPs daily for incidents they m ay not have detected through other 
means.  Because the thres hold for Coast Guard investigative action varies, IOs should 
communicate closely with SAR units to convey in vestigation program information 
needs.  With close relation ships in mind, IOs should have the in formation needed to 
assess possible incidents from the SITREP. 
D.4.CASUALTY 
REPORTS 
(CASREP S) Coast Guard  cutters, Nav y vessels, and vessels under contract to or operated by the 
Military Sealift Command  send CASR EPs when an accident occurs or when a piece 
of important equipment fails.  IOs should carefully screen all CASREPs, keeping in 
mind that M SC vessels may use the C ASREP as th e primary means of notification for 
a marine casualty.  The Coast Guard will inve stigate all pollution incidents aboard (via 
MOU) Navy and Coast Guard vessels.  NOTE:  the Coast Gu ard does not take 
enforcement action against Navy or Coast Guard vessels.
D.5.OPERATIONS 
SUMMARIES 
(OPSUM S) While SAR units send many SITREPs, not all incidents (or responses) warrant a 
SITREP.  In these cas es, the only men tion may co me in the Gr oup or District SAR 
Controller’s daily OPSUM.  IOs should main tain a close relati onship with District 
and Group Command C enters, assuring they recei ve copies of the OPSUM each day.  
IOs should review the O PSUM each morning for cases of which they m ay have 
otherwise been unaware.  Similarly, beca use OPSUMs are reviewed by head quarters 
program managers, IOs should present thei r most significant efforts in the daily 
OPSUM for the district.  
E.REPORTS FROM OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
E.1.GENERAL IOs shall maintain a close relationship with other la w enforcement agencies for a 
number of reasons.  These agencies, for instance, may be invol ved in investigating 
incidents tha t the Coas t Guard also invest igates.  Such contingencies should be 
considered, and where po ssible, a MOU between the local unit and the law 
enforcement agency should describe what in cidents will be jointly investigated, which 
agency will take the lead in which investigat ions, how criminal referrals will be made, 
and how reports of investigation (ROIs) will be drafted, approved, and released.  
These MOUs should also consider which types of incidents the Coast Guard  and 
other agencies will notify one another  of.  In units with large AOR’s, the IO will (by 
necessity) rely on these agencies for notific ations regarding incid ents, particularly 
 pollution incidents. 
E.2.HANDLING OF 
REPORTSReports from other law enforcement agen cies sho uld be treated as any other 
notification regarding an incident.  As suc h, the Co ast Guard’s a ction regarding the 
incident mus t be determined by weig hing the severity of the incident agains t other 
priorities, including workload.  Reports from other law enforcement agencies, 
however, should be treated with greater confidence than reports from other sources.  
Accordingly, less verification and validation needs to be done by IO's.   
E.3.MULTI-
INCIDENT 
INVESTIGATIONIn many instances, law en forcement ag encies  show more interes t in a pattern of law 
breaking or a pattern of incidents than in a single, isolated incident.  Accordin gly, IOs 
should be sensitive to the law enforcement agency’s investigation of a patter n of 
behavior, and should not force an isolated incident investigation to closure when 
other law enf orcement ag encies intend  to investigate as part of a  pattern of o ffenses. 
F.REPORTS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THE 
INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO) 
F.1.GENERAL The Office of Investigations and Analysis, Commandant (CG-545) acts as th e point 
of contact fo r the international commu nity under th e terms of th e Internation al Code 
for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents.  Under the code, certain 
incidents sho uld be referred to the flag administration for its action.  When incidents 
occur aboard  U.S. vessels in foreign water s, CG-545 receives referrals from other 
nations, and occasionally from the IMO. 
F.2.REPORTS 
FROM FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTSDepending upon the natu re of their encounter and their domesti c laws, foreign 
governments may refer a nearly compl eted cas e or a simple noti fication.  While each 
reported incident must be weighed against existing workload when considering what 
investigative action to take, units should weigh cases referred by foreign go vernments 
as more serious because Coast Guard action bears  on the United States’ international 
reputation.  In many cases, the Coast Guard will communicate with the Department 
of State in reporting what action we h ave taken.  Evidence, inter views, and anything 
else collected  by foreign govern ments may be used by IOs.

INTRODUCTIONThe method for fact-finding while conducting  an investigation includes, but is not 
necessarily limited to th e following steps: 
•Step One:  Inspecting the location;  
•Step Two:  Gathering and recording physical evidence;  
•Step Three:  Interviewing witnesses ta king into account cultural and  
  languages differences (on site and external);

FACT FINDING
B.1.
INTRODUCTION
B.2.EVALUATIONSA.OVERVIEW
•Step Six:  Conducting specialized studies. 
During the initial stages of every investigat ion, IOs should aim to gather an d record 
all the facts that may assist in determin ing causes.  IOs should be aware of th e 
dangers of re aching conclusions too early,  thereby failing to keep an open mind and 
consider the full range of possibilities.  It is essential that the fact-finding ste p of the 
investigation process be kept separate from the ana lysis of the collected evid ence 
leading to conclusions and recommendations. 
The objectiv e of the fact finding step of the in vestigation is to collect as man y facts as 
possible which assist in understanding the incident and the even ts surrounding it.  
The scope of  any investigation can be divide d into four areas: people, environment, 
equipment, and procedures.  Additionally, all casualty investigations will at a 
minimum cover the information required for reporting to the In ternational Maritime 
Organization (IMO). 
B.OPERATIONAL THREAT ASSESSMENT
As required by Volume 1 , Chapter 10 of this manual, all field units must have safe 
work practices (SWPs) that explain ho w to handle the various hazards likely 
encountered while performing Coast Guar d missions.  In practice, many fi eld 
personnel do not consider  all the hazar ds actually pr esent during an investigation, and 
accordingly do not consi der using the protective measures in the SWPs.  To use the 
SWPs appropriately, field personnel must  evaluate with each  and every on-scene 
deployment which hazar ds are present, and what measures they will take to protect 
themselves.  Whenever IOs and their teams go  on-scene during an investigation, they 
must consciously consider and plan how they will handle hazar ds prior  to deploying.  
This is called an Operational Threat Assessment . 
IOs should consciously consider each of the specific hazards listed in this section.

95 or person in charge what must be don e in order to secure the in cident scen e.   
IOs should ensure that all  potential witnesses are asked not to di scuss the inci dent 
with one ano ther before being interviewed.  They s hould be separated if possible.  
Witnesses’ recollections may be ch anged or influenced by oth ers, and IOs should 
recognize th at different witnesses no rmally r ecall the same event slightly differently.  
If all testimony regarding an incident is precisely the same, the I O should consider 
the possibility that the witnesses have i nteracted suf ficiently to al ter their testi mony. 
See also 46 USC Section 6303. 
The order of interviews will depend upon the manner in which the facts are 
developed a nd the access ibility of witnesses.   Witnesses should be interviewed as 
soon after the incident as possible.  It is generally best to intervi ew witness es who 
have the mo st complete overview of the inci dent first.  This would be the Master, 
Chief Engin eer, or person in charge.  Also, those witnesses who will not forewarn the 
potential sub ject of an investigation shou ld be interviewed before those who might 
reasonably b e expected to inform the potential su bject.  In this manner facts and 
information are obtained that can be u sed in  detecting inconsistencies or attempts to 
mislead on the part of witnesses who may be  unsympatheti c to the investigation.   
46 CFR 4.06 and 16.240 require that mari ne empl oyers condu ct drug and alcohol 
testing on mariners directly involved in a serious marine incident.  Drug and alcohol 
testing should be done as  soon as practicable withi n the 2-hour time limit.  While the 
burden for drug and alcohol testing rests on the marine employer, IOs shall remind 
mariners and marine empl oyers of their drug and alcohol testing responsibilities while 
securing the casualty scen e. 
46 CFR 4.06 requires marine employer s to ta ke all practicable steps to test in dividuals 
involved in a serious marine incident for evidence of drug and alcohol use as soon as 
possible after addressing the resulting saf ety concerns delineated  in 46 CFR 4.06-1(e).  
46 CFR 4.06-1(c) allows law enforcem ent officers (not necessari ly federal) to 
determine th at additional personnel are dir ectly involved in the incident, and thus 
must undergo drug testing.  46 CFR 16.250  require s Marine employers  to require 
drug and alcohol testing when they have probable cause to beli eve a mariner is under 
the influence of drugs or alcohol. Whether designated by the marine employer or a 
law enforcement officer, drug testing under these authorities is the responsibility of 
marine empl oyer, not the Coast Guar d. 
 33 CFR 95.035 authorizes the chemi cal testing of individuals suspected of b eing 
intoxicated  or directly involved in the occurrence of a marine casu alty.  Chemical tests 
should be directed whenever an individual appears to be intoxicated.  Unlike 
mandatory chemical tes ting after a serious marine incident, chemical tests ar e not 
automatically required whenever an in dividual is involved in a marine casua lty.  Good 
judgment and careful consideration of the seriousness and circumstances of a marine 
casualty sho uld be exercised before directi ng drug testing under 33 CFR 95.035.   
C.7.d.  Individuals to be Tested 
C.8.SECURING 
RECORDSC.8.a.  General 
When securing the scene of an incident, IOs should pay particul ar attention to timely 
securing of records that may, in some case s, be destroyed or erased.  Many electronic 
records (AR PA playback, voyage recorders, etc.) will automatically be lost after some 
period of time, generally a few hours.  Similarly, IOs should consider securing the 
Chief Mate’s office, where many recor ds (inc luding rough logs a nd cargo records) will 
be kept.  Most deck and engine officers keep rough notes, which may be th e only 
records available because smooth log entries ar e not foremost in a mariner’s priorities 
following an incident. 
D.1.GENERAL The SHEL model is a tool used to collect th e factual information necessary to fill in 
the timeline.  The SHEL model was d eveloped by Elwin Edwar ds and refined by NOTE: The standard of intoxication is de fined in 33 CFR 95.020 as: 1) an alcohol 
concentra tion of 0.08 percent by weight or more in their blood for recreational 
vessels, 2) an alcohol concentration of  0.04 percent by weight or more in thei r blood 
for vessels other than recr eational vess els, and 3) the effect of intoxicants co nsumed 
by the individual on the person’s manner, disposition, speech, muscular movement, 
general appearance or behavior is appare nt by obs ervation for any vessel.  33 CFR 
95.010 defin es an intoxicant as any form of alcohol, drug, or combination thereof. 
Under the post-casualty drug and alcohol tes ting regulations in 46 CFR 4.06, law 
enforcement officers may designate personnel as “directly involved” in a serious 
marine incident (as defin ed by 46 CFR 4.03-4), and therefore subject them to 
mandatory automatic dru g testing.  The pe rsonnel who can be designated as  directly 
involved in the incident a re limited to those actu ally aboard the vessel.  This 
restriction is stipulated in 46 CFR 4.06 -1(b) and 4.06-5(a) by the phrase “any 
individual engaged or employed on board a vessel...”  Given th is restriction, it is not 
feasible for the marine employer or law enforcem ent officer to extend the d rug and 
alcohol testi ng requirements to someone w ho was not actually aboard the vessel such 
as a dispatcher, drawbridge tender, or ba rge supervisor issuin g orders to a vessel 
master/oper ator. 
D.THE “SHEL”MODEL
 Captain Frank Hawkins as an investigation t ool.  It allows a mar ine investigator to 
explore the interaction of  the many o perational parts of the mar itime transpo rtation 
system.  The model effectively moves the focus from the individual (mariner) to the 
system.  Rather than focusing on any single element in the system, it assumes that any 
failure in the system resul ts from a mismatch between two or m ore of its 
components.   The IMO has suggested the SHEL model as a means for exploring the 
interaction o f all parts of the maritime tran sportati on system in  an acciden t, and the 
Coast Guard  has adopted  it as the princi pal means of conducting on-scene fact- 
finding.  The SHEL Mod el is a categorizat ion of the various conditions that the 
marine investigator may wish to record.  The SHEL model suggests that all of the 
operational elements of the maritime trans portation system bel ong to one of four 
categories.  Accordingly, the marine i nvestigator should observe the conditi on of the 
various elements in those four categories.  These categories are simply:  
Software:  The information and support systems gui ding people.   Software 
elements incl ude checklists, manuals, publications, procedures, regulatory 
requirements, training, education, maps, and charts. 
Hardware:  The vessels, facilities, machinery, cargo, equipment, and 
material people work with .  Hardware elements i nclude all ma chinery, gear, 
electronics, s witches, controls, and displays. 
Environment:  The internal and marine en vironment in which people 
work .  Environment elem ents include the internal environment such as 
workplace environment, room temper ature, ventilation, lighting, pitching and 
yawing, and the marine en vironment such as sea state, wind, ice, precipitation, 
and visibility. 
Liveware:  The people themselves.   Liveware elements inclu de all of the people 
involved in the acciden t both directly and indirectly. 
 
############
 •Visual limitations.  Visual limitations can cause illusions and disorientation, or 
impair reading of instru ments and charts.  Examples of visual limitations are: 
color blindness, visual acuity, depth perception, and requirement for glasses 
or contact lenses. 
•Hearing limitations.  Hearing limitations on the par t of the individual can 
leave an individual unaware of faint sounds or sounds in a specific affected 
hearing range.  This factor refers to the individual’s capability, n ot to ambien t 
noise or environmental conditions. 
•Smell limitations. 
•Touch limitations. 
D.5.
PHYSIOLOGICAL 
FACTORSNutrition Factors.   Nutrition potenti ally affects an individual’s ability to respond to 
action or resist fatigue.  Consider: 
•Time since last meal 
•Food intake during last 24 hours 
•Recent weight loss 
•Recent dieting  
Health Factors.  Health factor can di rectly af fect performance.  Consider: 
•Diseases 
•Pains 
•Dental condi tions 
•Pregnancy 
•Obesity 
•Recent bloo d donation 
•Smoking (reduces dexteri ty, impairs vision, & affects judgement of time) 
•Alcohol/drugs (over-the-counter med ication, prescribed medication, coffee, 
illegal drugs, alcohol abuse, etc.) 
Fatigue.   Consider: 
•Short Term Fatigue.  Short-term fatigue can be inf luenced by the amount o f
sleep, duration or work period, and the nature of tasks, among other factors. 
•Long Term (Chronic) Fatigue.  Long  term fatigue may depend on work 
schedule, ability to cope with stress, a nd sleeping patterns. (K nown effects  of 
stress include an impact on short-term memory, concentra tion, ability to 
make decisio ns, risk taking, and taking “short cuts.”) 
 Illusio ns.  Illusions can be induced by the environment, and in clude: 
•Environmental Illusions, such as “black hol e,” fl icker vertigo, an d circular or 
linear vection.   
•Vestibular Illusions can include somatogyral (the leans) or somatogravic 
(coriolis). 
D.6.
PSYCHOLOGICAL 
FACTORSInformation Processing .  Factors to consider include the possi bility that th e 
amount of information to be processed exceeded the individual’s own limitations 
(mental capacity) leading to poor judgment. 
Perceptions.   Factors to consider include dela yed perceptions, inaccurate p erception 
(mental pictu re) of the tas k to be performed, leading to slow reaction or wrong 
reactions. 
Attention.   Atten tion factors consider that the lev el of attentio n required during a 
task may exceed the indiv idual’s own limitations.  Consider: 
•Atten tion sp an 
•Fixation 
•Distraction 
Workload.   Workload and its perceived level ca n be increased through an operator’s 
or crew’s own actions, ca using stress, panic, incorrect prioritiza tion of tasks, and loss 
of situational awareness. 
Attitudes.  The attitudes  of individuals toward their work, mission, others, and 
themselves can affect per formance.  Consider: 
•Boredom 
•Overconfidence 
•“Press on – i tis” 
Mental / Emotional State.   The mental or emoti onal state of a person influences 
their approach to situations and can influence their ability to res pond in an 
emergency.  These factor s may appear as si gns of panic, stress, and anxiety in cluding 
fixation, gazing, and very slow reaction times.  Consider: 
•Apprehensio n / fear 
•Arousal level
Personality Traits .  Personality traits may predisp ose an individual to a certain 
response pattern in a given situation.  Through interviews with co-workers and 
 friends, investigators can identify such characteristi cs as: 
•Hostility 
•Excitability 
•Impulsiveness 
•“Macho-ness” 
Experience / Recency .  Experience and recency i nclude attention to the sui tability 
of a person’s experience, and the recency of  that experience, to  the situation .
Consider: 
•The person’s overall experience 
•The person’s recent exper ience 
•The person’s experience on a particular type of eq uipment 
•The person’s experience with  a particular procedure 
Training.   Consider: 
•The type of training the person has received 
•Indications of positive or negative tr ansfer (did they get the mess age?) 
•Weaknesses observed during training 
Planning.  The planning of an operation, but prior to and during the operation can 
reflect the o perator’s or management’s atti tudes.  Limited planning can result in 
incomplete i nformation, biasing decision-making, and bad judgment. 
D.7.
PSYCHOSOCIAL 
FACTORSPsychosocial factors have an importan t role as they influence an individual’s 
approach to a situation a nd their ability to  handles  stress, as well as the degree of 
fatigue experienced.  Consider any event from a person’s social environment that is 
important en ough to negatively influence behaviors or create stress.  To evaluate the 
pressure and stress levels experienced by  a person, compare the individual’s 
perception of events against the perceptions  of others. Consider whether any of the 
following ma y be relevant: 
•Friends 
•Family 
•Interpersonal conflicts Knowledge. A person’s knowledge about equipm ent, systems,  procedures, or the 
environment may be inad equate, resulting  in reduced confidence, confusion, or 
inappropriate actions. 
•Peers 
 •Cultural differences 
•Personal loss (grief, shock, stress) 
•Money / financial problems 
•Activities 
•Life style 
•Work 
D.8.MISMATCHES 
BETWEEN COMPONENTSThe rough edges between the compo nents in the SHEL diagram are symbo lic of the 
fact that the mismatch  between an in dividual and these comp onents is important.  
These possible mismatches warrant special atten tion by the mari ne investigator 
because mis matches in the system m ay point  out safety deficiencies.  Exam ples of 
mismatches between a person an d other components include: 
Person to Policy & Procedures (liveware-software) Misma tches :  
Mismatches between liveware and software  includ e problems in the transfer of 
information between sup port systems  and the pers on.  Outdated publications, for 
instance, gen erate a mism atch by giving the person incorrect information. 
Person to Equi pment & Gear (liveware-hardware) Mismatches :Mismatches 
between liveware and har dware include problems in the physica l and mental 
interaction of people and machines.  Design limitations, instrument/control 
design and location, instrument contr ols and readability, seat design, proper 
guards and protections an d other ergonomic issues are instances of these 
mismatches.
Person to Environment (livew are-environment) Mismatches .  Mismatches 
between peo ple and environment are f acts that affect human performance.  For 
example temperature, humidity, illumination or  glare, ambient noise, vibration, air 
quality, external visibility, pitch and yaw each hav e an effect on a person’s ability 
to perform his or her task optimally. 
The following lists (D9-D12) contain the various areas of examination of 
mismatches.  The lists are not exhausti ve. 
D.9.PERSON TO 
PERSON (LIVEWARE-
LIVEWARE)Oral Communication .  Tapes and witness interviews can help  identify 
misinterpretations, misunderstandings, and improper language use.  Consider: Person to Person (livew are-liveware) Mismatches .  Mismatches between 
people and o ther people i nclude voice communicati ons, working language, 
phraseology, speech rate, readback/hearb ack, briefings, personal interactions,
crew coordination, and non-verbal ques such as hand signals. 
 MISMATCHES•Noise interference 
•Content and rate of speech 
•Readback/h earback procedures for oral instructions 
•Visual signals that replace, support, or contradict or al or other information.  
Examples include confusing body language, or other non-verbal cues. 
Crew Intera ction.   Crew interaction includes cr ew compatibility in terms of 
personality, experience level, and working habits.  These factors can cause p eople to 
work for or against each other, or  fail to use all available resources. 
Worker – Management Factors .  Consider: 
•The level wh ere decisions and plans are formulated 
•The level were resources are allocated
•The supervisory level were actions are monitored a nd instructions followed 
•The influence of management policies on personnel issues (perhaps causing 
excessive wo rkload or unhealthy work  environments) 
Supervision Factors .  Supervision factors include the existence,  availability, and 
currency of standards, policies, and quality controls , as well as supervisory presence 
(or absence), monitoring, style, etc. 
D.10.PERSON TO 
POLICY (LIVEWARE-
SOFTWARE)

E.INSPECTING THE INCIDENT SCENE
E.1.GENERAL
E.2.a.  Inspection during the Course of an 
Investigation 
The Coast G uard has authority to enforce environmental and s afety regulations and, 
as such have legitimate access to ships and facilities governed by these regulations.  
Coast Guard  regulations give notice to regulated entities to anti cipate inspection, and 
various international and federal laws require  those ships and facilities to hold certain 
areas open for inspection.  No suspicion whatever is required to initiate an 
inspection, a nd an inspection may inv olve entering and checkin g any space i f
reasonably related to appli cable admini strative and s afety regulations, or to the chain 
of events in an incident.
E.2.b.  Reasonableness in the Scope of the Inspection 
A vessel or facility inspection is not a basi s of authority for USCG personnel to go 
anywhere a board a vessel or facility subject to  U.S. jurisdiction  The reasona ble extent 
of an inspection is measured by the ex tent of its intrusion into areas where there is a 
legitimate ex pectation of privacy.  Courts have ruled that no reasonable exp ectation 
of privacy exists in the m achinery and  cargo spaces  of a ship, and in areas subject to 
common access of those legitimately a board the vessel. 
E.2.c.  Proper Inspections 
Properly conducted vessel and facility inspecti ons are fully consistent with the Fourth 
Amendment standards in that th ey are:
•Serve an important public interest; and
•Involve areas where a les ser expectati on of privacy exists. 
E.2.d.  Evidence of Criminal Activity 
When IOs have a reasonable suspicion of ille gal ac tivity, but collecting evidence of 
that activity requires examination of spaces  or persons beyond the scope of a normal 
facility or vessel inspectio n, the IO sha ll expeditiously request guidance from their mismatches are Latent Unsa fe Co nditions (LU Cs) that sho uld be exa mined in 
the Causal Analysis . 
Whenever ti mely notice of an incident is received, inspection of the incident scene 
must be a hi gh priority for the IO.  Appropriate inspection of the incident s cene will 
reveal much of the information neces sary for accurate and com plete analys es of the 
facts and cau ses. 
E.2.INSPECTIONS 
AND SEARCHES
•Limited in scope;  
 servicing legal office.  IOs SHALL NOT extend n ormal inspections such th at any 
person’s Fourth Amendment rights are infringed upon.   
Notwithsta nding any of the above, an  IO or other individual properly qualified to 
conduct law enforcement operations may proceed  in accordan ce with th e MLEM. 
F.EVIDENCE
IOs collect evidence to es tablish truth.  Evidence p roves or disproves (or tends to 
prove or disprove) the tr uth of a fact or matter in question. The word “evidence” 
means any m atter of fact from which a n inference may be drawn as to a second 
matter of fact that is in qu estion.  Evidence ma y be physical, oral, or written 
(documentary) and ma y concern an in cident, circu mstances, or actions relev ant to th e 
issues.  There are three basic types of evidence: 
•Direct Evidence (includes  witness statements and testimony) 
•Indirect Evidence (a.k.a. circumstanti al evidence, generally ten ds to ‘disprove’ 
something or indirectly prove something) 
IOs should pursue them all. 
F.2.WHEN 
CONTROL OF 
EVIDENCE IS 
REQUIREDWhenever ev idence (i.e. pollution samples) is taken in support of a criminal 
investigation, control of evidence with  a proper cha in of custody in accordan ce with 
COMDTINST M16201.1 (series) is required.  For any other purposes, control of 
evidence is a t the discreti on of the Senior Marine Investigator. 
F.2.b.  Transfer of Custody 
F.3.CONTROL FOR 
LATER 
IDENTIFICATION•A descriptio n of the evidence (what it is); 
•Where it was  found (being very specific as to the lo cation: “… from the 
bottom right drawer of the desk in the office of the Chief Engineer.” F.1.GENERAL
•Real Evidence (includes physical and documentary evidence) 
F.2.a.  General 
When CGIS Special Agen ts are involved in a case, original evid ence should normally 
be transferred to them.  All original evid ence should be secured  in a locked evidence 
locker (locked refrigerator for oil) until transfer/disposition instructions are received 
from the prosecutor.  Access to, and the release of, evidence from an eviden ce locker 
should be controlled by as few as personnel as possible who should maintain a log 
recording evidence received and evidence released.   An IOs locking file drawers may 
serve as an evidence locker, provided the IO has s ole access to the drawer, that it 
remains locked, and that proper chain of custody control forms are rigorously used.   
Whenever control of evidence is requ ired, the IO must prepare careful 
documentation that will show: 
•Who found the evidence;
 •What happened to the evidence after i twas collected/seized, (the complete 
chain of custody.) 
F.4.IDENTIFYING 
EVIDENCE F.4.a.  Process for Identifying Evidence 
When physical evidence, including pollution samples, are collected (e.g. pollution 
samples after  a pollution incident, lube oil samples after a mech anical failure), they 
should be placed in an appropriate container (a sample jar for oil samples; a seal-able 
plastic bag for samples of garbage, plastic, or other pollutants) and sealed with 
evidence tap e, which shal l be initialed and dated by the person who collected the 
sample and then assigned an ECN.  Other physical  evidence that cannot b e feasibly 
placed in one of the abov e mentioned or ot her type containers (i .e. a large overboard 
valve) shall be appropriately tagged.  The ta g will be initial and dated by the person 
who collected the sample and then given an ECN.
The ECN is simply an identification giving  a “short hand” for identifying evidence.  
The IO shall assign each piece of evidence an E CN .  The following is the 
recommended format: Activity Numb er (from MISLE), a sequential number as it is 
discovered (1, 2, 3, etc.), and the collector’s initials.   
EXAMPLE : CDR Kelly M. Post colle cted evidence in support of MISLE Incident 
Investigation Activity 1024581.  This is the second piece of evidence collected for 
this investigation.  The ECN would look like this:  1024581-02-KMP 
Because th e general “walk around” (insp ection/in vestigation technique of walking 
around the scene) rarely occurs at an em pty scene,  operations will usually be going on 
at the tim e that IOs take evidence into custody.  In some insta nces, copies of the 
documentary evidence will be sufficien t, and IOs should plan how they will make 
copies in this case. 
F.6.SELECTING 
WHICH EVIDENCE TO 
TAKEWhen collecting evidence, the IO must assign each piece of evidence (i.e. ea ch 
document or  small group of documents) an Evidence Control Number (ECN).  The 
IO should have a list of each piece of evidence they control with a brief description 
of the evidence, where it i s located, wh o took custo dy/discovered it, and it’s 
final/current disposition.

DOCUMENTARY 
EVIDENCE
By the very nature of human beings, the most pro ductive and efficient work (with 
regard to evidence) will be done during the “walk around” – not weeks later while 
reviewing the files.  While there is a tempt ation to “take everything,” this w ill cause 
both alarm a nd ultimately much more work.  In order to minimize the a mount of 
irrelevant evidence tak en into custody, the IOs and /or Marine Board Recorder 
should review checklists of equipment, re ports, documents, etc., that would be 
expected to have valuable information to  the occu rrence.  Although additional 
evidence will inevitably surface, this concentr ated time spent at the beginning of the 
 G.PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
Because an I O will not necessarily know which ev idence is relevant to the fi ndings of 
fact or concl usions regarding cause, physical evidence should be broadly documented 
and key pieces of evidence should be taken in to cus tody.  In general, where a piece of 
physical evidence may be fully docume nted through photographs, etc., (e.g. a 
substitute original) it is preferable not to take th e object into evi dence.  Where 
enforcement proceedings may result (as in environmental crimes), however, the 
object shoul d be taken in to custody.

SUBPOENAS TO 
COMPEL THE 
PRODUCTION OF 
PHYSICAL EVIDENCEG.4.a.  General 
An IO may s erve a subpoena on the custodia n of certain evidence necessary for the 
purposes of an investigation.  The subpoe na orders the custodian to appear with 
specific books, papers, re cords, or docume nts so that they may be used as ev idence 
and be admitted into the official record of the investigation.  See Chapter A3 for 
more information. “walk around” will short en the overall length of the investigation. 
G.1.GENERAL
The authority to collect a nd retain ph ysical eviden ce is implicit in the Coast Guard’s 
authorizing statutes for investigation and law enforcement.  The IO should contact 
the servicing legal office immediately i f his or her authority to collect and/or  retain 
evidence is challenged during fact-finding. 
Retention of  original records and documents on bo ard ships is guided by the IMO 
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) an d Marine Environment Protection Co mmittee 
(MEPC) joint circular MSC-MEPC.4/Circ.1.  In accordance with this policy, and IO 
shall only take the original documents when necess ary for the investigation.  IOs 
should accep t a certified copy if it is legible and conveys the exact  information as the 
original (e.g. erasures, pertinent differences in  color of ink or sty le of writing, if any, 
torn pages, handwritten comments - especially tho se written in margins, and any 
indication of possible tampering - whit e-out, and extra pages taped in).  Coordination 
with the serv icing legal office is urged in making the determinati on of necessity. 
Always provide the oppor tunity for the Master  to certify (under direct supervision) 
and retain copies.  Upon removal of an orig inal, be prepared to provide a certified 
copy to th e master as ex peditiously a s possi ble, especially if the document i s required 
for the vessel to attes t to their complia nce with vari ous laws, regulations or 
international  treaties and protocols.  Do not stamp certified copies as “Certified to be 
True.” When providing certified copies to the vessel , avoid characterizing documents 
as being truthful.  The IO shall provide a l etter to the master identifying the original 
documents r emoved.   
 G.4.b.  Subpoenas for Cooperative Custodians of 
Evidence 
It is sometimes in the interest of the Co ast Guard to subpoena cooperative witnesses, 
as a witness under subpoena is in a more fa vorable position under the laws relating to 
the protection of witnesses.  Individuals under subpoena are usu ally less reluctant to 
give testimony detrimental to friends or relatives or in some wa y derogatory to 
themselves.  Furthermore, some private agen cies (s uch as drug testing consortiums) 
routinely require subpoenas for the production of their records, as a protecti on to 
themselves.  Additionally, some employers require a subpoena befo re they will permit 
an employee to miss work in order to testify. 
G.5.VIDEO AND 
AUDIO TAPEG.5.a.  General 
IOs are auth orized and encouraged to videotape or  otherwise record their 
inspections/investigation of facilities and/or vessels, particularly following significant 
occurrences, bearing in mind that still phot ographs are often more easily presented 
and used in formal proceedings.  Also, keep in mind that while vi deotaping, 
conversations will be recorded and should maintain a professional demeanor.  Video 
taping should be limited to open and obvio us recording in an area the are p ermitted 
to be and ma y not be con ducted cover tly.   
G.5.b.  When Permitted 
From a legal standpoint, a n IO may videotape or o therwise record anything where 
the IO has the lawful right to be (i.e.,  anyplace du ring the inspection); and/ or any 
conversation  in which the IO is participating.  As a matter of pol icy, the IO s hall 
ensure that r ecorded interviews begin with a statement from the person being 
interviewed that he or she has no objection to the r ecording of the interview. IOs 
should exercise considered judgment in recording interviews, in that recordi ng can 
cause witnes ses discomfort and limit their testimo ny.  Similarly, excessive recording 
can needlessl y complicate the investigative case file. 
The use of concealed recording devic es is not authorized. 
Each inspection or interview should be recorded on a unique tape or other recording 
medium (rather than hav e multiple interviews or inspections on  the same ta pe).  The 
tape should have the following information written on it: 
•Date of the r ecording; 
•Time of the recording; 
•Subject of the recording, and G.5.c.  Concealed Recording Devices 
G.5.d.  Individual Audio/Video Tapes 
•Person making the recording; 
 •ECN 
G.6.PHOTOGRAPHS
•Orientation to the scen e of the incident; 
•An accura te record of details; 
•May show (i m)proper use/assembly of equipment or materials ; 
•Documents evidence of marks, spills, etc.; and 
Pictures should be taken of the overhead view, view from four points, medium range 
shots for orientation, close-up shots for d etail, weather (wh en applicable), etc.  For 
scale, IOs should place a ruler (or other obj ect of known size) or people in the photo.  
It also helps to place smal l objects on a blue background for color detail.  IOs should 
keep a log of photos taken that includ es the date, ti me, location and subject 
information. 
G.7.a.  General 
Many moder n vessels carry enormous amounts of electronic da ta on Voyage Data 
Recorders (VDRs).  VDRs integrate inputs from many pieces of equipment 
(including GPS, radars, rudder and engine  order telegraph) with audio recordings 
from conceal ed microphones located throughou t the bridge.  Data obtained by the 
VDR can help to corroborate witness statements, identify or eliminate equipment 
malfunction, evaluate crew performance, and quan tify environmental condi tions 
eliminating much of the guesswork in determi ning causal factor s in the investigation.  
This could prove critical in determinin g which regulations, equipment, and 
operational p rocedures require modifica tion to prevent these accidents from 
happening again.  This information is recorded in various ways on various kinds of 
media; they a re often reco rded-over every twen ty-four to forty-eight hours.  
Therefore, if VDR information is deemed nece ssary, it should be obtained in a timely 
manner.  The IO should keep in mind that VDR d ata is readabl e only with the 
required software from the VDR manufacturer.   CG-545 will p rovide assistance in 
this matter. 
G.7.b.  Divers and ROV’s Photographs are an excell ent way to d ocument  physical evidence or information.  It 
provides (and is not limited to) th e following: 
•Records relative positions; 
•Show deterio ration or lack of maintenance. 
G.7.ELECTRONIC 
RECORDS
Many times when dealing with a vessel  sinking without the possi bility of salvage, the 
collection of physical evidence is nearl y impossible.   The use of divers and/or a 
Remote Op erated Vehicl e (ROV) can be very  useful in obtaining video evidence.  
Frequently the vessel owners or operators opt to secure and u se divers and ROVs.  
The evidence collected can be obtain ed by subpo ena.  The IO  should keep in mind 
that Marine Safety and S ecurity Team s may also  have resources available, such as side 
scan sonar and ROVs.  
 G.8.OTHER 
PHYSICAL EVIDENCEOther physical evidence may be collected by the IO as deem ed necessary.  This may 
include items  such as lifesaving equipment, dive gear, paint scrapings, piping, etc.  
CG-545 can provide assistance wi th the analysis of physical evidence collected, 
including lab  analysis.
H.DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
H.1.
INTRODUCTIONDocumentary evidence in cludes all kinds of documents, records, and writings, and is 
subject to th e same rules of evidence a soral testim ony.  While the testimon y of 
people maki ng log book entries or the actual  docu ments thems elves are the preferred 
evidence, getting testimon y or retaining documents  is not possible or desirable in 
every instance.  Further, IOs often coll ect docum entary evidence that tends to 
corroborate other evidence, such as test imony.  Copies of documentary evid ence 
should ensure that the entries are legible.  When they are not legible, a typewr itten 
extract shoul d be made. 
H.2.PHOTOCOPIES Photocopies should be certified on the revers e side as in the following example:  “I 
hereby certif y that I have seen the original  logbook and that the reverse of this sheet 
is a true and correct copy of page 46, b ook I, the Official Logbook of the M/V 
SEALAND TRADER, for the voyage commen cing February 1, 2003 [dated and 
signed by the IO, including rank and duty station].”    The copy s hould also be 
authenticated as a true copy and signed by  the m aster of the vessel, along with the 
date and time.   
H.3.EXTRACTS When extracts are typewritten, only th ose en tries p ertinent to th e case need be 
extracted.  They shall be certified as in the following example: “I hereby certify that I 
have examined the official logbook, compared  the above extract to it, and found it to 
be a true and  correct copy of all entries pertaining to Joseph Drake on page 17, book 
II of the Official Logbook of the M/V SEALAN D TRADER  for the voyage 
commencing  February 1, 2003 [dated and signed by the IO, including rank and duty 
station].” 
H.4.SHIPPING 
ARTICLESCoast Guard  forms CG-705A, and thei r equivalents constitute contractual 
agreements between the mas ter and members of the crew on U.S. ships.  46 USC 
10302 defines the particulars to be includ ed for foreign or intercoastal voyages (see 
NVIC 1-86) on U.S. vess els.  When the vessel will be making a foreign voya ge, they 
are referred to as “foreign” articles; when the vessel  is on a coastwise voyage, they are 
“coastwise” articles.  Shipping articles or properly authenticated extracts m ade on 
form CG-2639H (extract of shipping a rticles – used when photocopiers were not 
available) provide evidence that a mar iner was abo ard a specific vessel at the time of 
an incident.   
H.5.OFFICIAL 
LOG BOOKSLogbooks contain important evidence regardin g most incidents;  the following policy 
applies to the review of logbooks and use of logbooks as documentary evid ence.  
 Under 46 US C 11301, U.S . vessels making fo reign and intercoastal voyages must have 
an “Official Logbook” a nd make certain entries in them.  Logbook offenses listed in 
46 USC 11501 and made in accordan ce wi th 46 USC 11502 may constitu te prima 
facie evidence of the facts  they recite.  Foreign vessels are not required to have an 
Official Logbook by U.S. law, but almost  all home administrations have a par allel 
requirement.  
H.6.OTHER 
DOCUMENTSThere are nu merous documents kept aboard a vessel which may be valuable in 
determining the facts surrounding an incident.  The IO should consider examining 
the following shipboard documents (when applicable): 
•Ship’s registe r; 
•Current certificates; 
•Charts and record of cha rt correction s; 
•Oil Record Books for cargo and bunker. 
•Oil Transfer Procedures 
•Echo Sounder Chart; 
•Crew list and crew Merch ant Mariners’ Credentials, including state pilots’ 
licenses. 
•Articles of Agreement 
•Vessel Resp onse Plans, garbage plans, etc. 
•Declaration of Inspection 
•Vessel Maneuvering Characteristics 
•Bell Books (Bridge and Engineroom) 
•Radio Log  
•ISM Code certification; 
•Crew qualifications; 
•Course recorder 
•Deck Log Book; 
•Port log, and  log abstract; 
•Captain’s Night Orders 
•Personal log books (typically for deck and engine officers only) 
•Cargo Orders Book (like the Captain’s Night Orders but issued by the Chief •Passenger list; 
•Bridge Log Book (other than the official log book) 
•Weather Log 
•Captain’s Standing Orders 
 Mate regarding cargo operations 
•Ship Reporting Records 
•Voyage plan
•Engineroom Log Book; 
•Chief Engin eer’s Standing Orders; 
•Maintenance record; 
•Maintenance manuals; 
•Bar records - daily purchases - voyage receipts, etc.;
•Pilot notes, trip sheets, and voyage plans; 
•Master-Pilot conference card (typically held by the pilot) 
H.7.AUTOMATION 
RECORDSMany vessels have autom ated record k eepin g for su ch as engine order logs, al arm 
logs, shaft sp eeds, and so on.  These de vices record the sequence of events in 
significant detail, including precise times and exa ct events (e.g. shaft RPM increased 
at precisely 0 8:31:20).  IOs should exerci se caution i n evaluating this form of 
evidence.  Specifically, automated logs are only as good as their last calibratio n, and 
should not be accep ted without some degree of confidence that the times an d actions 
reported are accurate.  Accordingly, such  documents should be discussed during 
interviews with the staff responsible for their maintenance to ensure they ar e valid 
records. 
The IO should collect all pertinent co mpany polici es and recor ds that are a pplicable 
to the incident.  Many of these will be in cluded in the company’s Safety Management 
System.  These documents will be of great assistance if causal or human error analysis 
is required. 
I.ORAL EVIDENCE
I.1.GENERAL IOs rely principally upon oral evidence to determin e the sequen ce of events i n an 
incident.  This evidence is collected in interviews, which are deta iled but informal 
questionings of witnesses or other people wi th knowledge of the incident.  Interviews 
can be more or less formal, ranging from  a brief questioning to determine th at 
bystanders di d not witnes s an event (e.g., people pier-side at the time two vessels 
collided), to a formal deposition of witnesses who will likely be unavailable to give 
direct testim ony at a la ter date.  This evidence should be collected in forms ranging 
from the IO’s notes to tra nscriptions of recorded testimony; no chain of custody is 
normally required for suc h evidence, though IOs should be prepared to provide an 
affidavit attesting to the a uthenticity o f notes  prepa red from oral testimony.  For this •Notes kept b y deck officers regarding cargo operations, etc., and by oilers 
regarding their rounds; 
H.8.COMPANY 
RECORDS AND 
POLICIES
 reason, telephonic interviews should be limi ted to those investigations where only a 
brief summary of the facts is desired or to determin e information leading to other 
sources of information.   
I.2.ON-SITE 
WITNESSESInterviews shall generally begin with the sh ip man agement tea m, including the Master 
and Chief Engineer who can provide an overview of the incident, and conti nue with: 
•First hand witnesses present at th e occurrence site at the tim e of the 
occurrence itself, regardle ss of rank / position in the organizati on; 
•First hand witnesses present at th e occurrence site at the tim e of the 
occurrence itself, but from outside th e organizatio n.  Examples could be 
berthing or mooring assistance or visiting personnel such as agents or 
contractors; 
•First hand witnesses present at th e tim e of the occu rrence but n ot at th e 
occurrence l ocation itself.  Examples could be ship’s staff on the bridge of a 
ship witnessing a mooring incident on the main deck below; 
•Those not in volved with the incident itself but involved in the im mediate 
aftermath, es pecially thos e engaged in th e recovery process.  Examples could
be those inv olved in damage control, shipboard fire fighting or first aid 
medical treatment; 
•Tug, mooring boat, or pilot vessel crews; 
•Shore-based fire fi ghters;
•Pier / terminal staff; 
•Other vessel s in the imm ediate vicinity; and 
•Operators of Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). 
I.3.OFF-SITE 
WITNESSESIOs shall consider interviewing the following off-site witness es: 
Designated p erson under the ISM Code; 
Ship operators ashore; 
Company general managers ashore; 
Specialist co nsultants (rel evant to th e incident); 
Port or flag state inspecto rs; 
Regulatory authorities; 
Classification Society Representatives ;
Safety comm ittee member s including crew represen tatives; and •First hand witnesses present at th e tim e of the occu rrence but n ot at th e 
occurrence l ocation itself and from outside the organization.  Examples could 
be a pilot on  the bridge witnessing a mooring incident on the deck below; 
•Search and rescue person nel including helicopter cr ews; 
Technical su perintendents ashore; 
 Designers, shipbuilders, manufacturers and repairers. 
I.4.SCOPE OF 
INTERVIEWS
I.5.PREPARATION 
FOR INTERVIEWSWithin the limits of available time, thorough preparation should be made pr ior to an 
interview to ensure that a ll pertinent details are cov ered. Preparation should include a 
detailed stud y of the material that has already been accumulated, including the scene 
of the incident.  The IO shall become familiar with the laws, regulations, and 
guidance ma terial applica ble to the m atter under investigation, along with any job 
aids.  In some cases, IOs may find it valuable to discuss the situ ation in non-specific 
terms with experts in the field, whether  inside or outside the C oast Guard.  
Familiarity with these factors will enable the IO to properly prepare a brief, detect 
any discrepancies and falsehoods in the subject’s s tatements, and discourage the 
subject from withholding or distorting info rmation.  On the basi s of such a detailed 
study, the I O shall carefully determine the following: 
•Proper persons to be interviewed; 
•Probable degree of willingness of each person to be questioned; 
•Manner of interview and psychology to be employed, based on the subject’s 
position, willingness, relia bility, pe rsonality, and per sonal weaknesses as 
revealed by the evidence collected to that point;  
•Location of the interview; and 
•Outline of questions to which the an swers are already con clusively known 
and which ca n be used to test the subj ect’s truthfulness.   
I.5.b.  Background Information 
Background information which may b e appropriate to review p rior to conducting 
interviews includes, but is not limited to: 
•Records of instruction / briefings given on the particular job being 
investigated. 
•Location plans; 
•Command structure and persons involved;  The scope of  an interview will vary depending on the degree to which the person 
being interviewed was in volved in the incident.  In general, however, interviews 
should develop information relevant to th e scope of the investigation as a whole, 
namely th e chain of events leading to the incident a nd the peopl e, environment, 
equipment, a nd procedures that co ntributed. 
I.5.a.  General 
•Reliability of their information, and an y factors that may conscio usly or 
unconsciously influence, color, or distort such information; 
•Procedures for the type o f operation involved; 
•Messages, directions, etc.,  given from base/headqu arters concer ning the 
work; and 
 •Any other relevant information tha t may allow th e investigator to understa nd 
the context of the incident and testim ony.

I.7.b.  Manner of the Interview 
People can feel intimidated when con fronted by to o many inter viewers.  Experience 
has shown that interviews can be effectively cond ucted by two  interviewers and if 
appropriate, the witness may be a ccompanie d by a friend or le gal representative. 
During the course of an interview, the IO may sus pect th e pers on being interviewed 
has committed a criminal violation.  In this case, IOs should continue the i nterview, 
but shall avoid allowing the interview to becom e accusatory an d focused on the 
individual actions.  Instea d, the interview s hould seek to docum ent as much factual 
information as possible regarding the occu rrence.  IOs will not advise people being 
interviewed of their rights unless the interview has escalated to the level of a custodial Once th e situation in the immediate a ftermath of an incident ha s been stabili zed and 
the threa t to people, property, and the en vironment has been removed, the IO may 
require that everyone involved commit thei r recollections to pa per in the form of a 
written sta tement.  The p eople involved may requ est to wai t until their lawyers arrive, 
or refuse to give testimony (written o r oral) until such time.  In the event th at witness 
statem ents can be obtain ed expeditio usly, IOs can use these wi tness statem ents to 
further prepare for specific interviews and to revise the order of the interviews.   
An interview should start with the intr oduction of the IO and a ny other peo ple 
present, the purpose of the investigat ion and the i nterview (to find out what 
happened in the matter of …), and the possible future use of the information gained 
during the interview.  Because evidence gathered b y IOs may la ter be used a s part of 
a criminal prosecution un der many U.S. statutes, IOs are NOT  to indicate i n any way 
that the inter view cannot or will not be used in  criminal proceedings.  If asked about 
the possibility of criminal liability by a witness or involved person before or during a 
interview, the IO should respond with  words to the effect that "the United States is 
free to choos e civil, criminal, or administra tive enforcement when an alleged  violation 
is detected, a nd any decisi on to take o ne type of action does no t preclude an other 
type of actio n." 
People should be interviewed singly and be  asked to go step-by-step through the 
events surrounding the occurrence, d escribi ng both their own actions and the actions 
of others.  The value of a witness’s sta temen t can b e greatly influenced by th e style of 
the interviewer, whose ma in task is to lis ten to the witness’s sto ry and not to  be 
influenced.  IOs should hold their questions until the witness h as completed  their 
narrative, and then use th ose question s to elucidate unclear area s of the testi mony.

 interrogation.  Whether a situation is custodial depends on whether a reasonable 
person in the suspect’s po sition would believe their freedom of movement h as been 
limited in a way tha t approaches formal arrest (S ee Also Cha pter A3 D.12 – Miranda 
Warnings). Additional interviews or interroga tions of the person should be conducted 
by personnel  trained and authorized to cond uct cr iminal investigation interrogations. 
I.8.COOPERATION 
OF WITNESSESOccasionally, a witness refuses to answer questions posed by an IO, on the grounds 
that th e ans wers would be self-incriminating.  Individuals have the right not to 
answer perso nal questions under the Fifth Amendm ent, but IOs should not halt their 
investigations because a witness exerts hi s or her Fifth Amendment rights.  Other 
witnesses ma y be availabl e for interview, etc.   
The Fifth Amendment a pplies to personal in form ation (i.e., what that person has 
done), and n ot to general information.  A person, for instance, might legitimately 
refuse to answer questions such as “how did this oil spill happen?”  He or she, 
however, would have no Fifth Amendment basis to avoid questions such as  “who is 
your supervisor?” or “what is your co mpany’s policy regarding notifying the Coast 
Guard?” 
I.8.c.  Compelling Testimony 
If the IO does not believ e that a witn ess’s claim to  Fifth Amendment protection is 
legitimate, he or she should consult their servicin g legal officer.  An order may be 
sought from the federal district court d irecting the person to testi fy in accorda nce 
with the subpoena, or if appropriate, immuni ty may be granted by the Dep artment of 
Justice.  See Chapter A3 of this volume fo r the a dministrative procedures for seeking 
such an order or grant of immunity.

I.8.b.  Applicability of the Fifth Amendment 
At the end o f an interview, the IO sh ould summarize the discu ssion to ensure that 
there are no misunderstandings.  This summary  is invaluable both in clarifying the 
IO’s impressions of the interview and  in documen ting the interview for the 
investigative record. 
During formal investigations, IOs contract for a co urt reporter to record and 
transcribe all testimony.  Similarly, au dio or  video recordings of testimony may also 
be transcribed when paper or electronic record s are easier to reference or review than 
the audio or videotape.  Court reporting services currently offer copies of the 
transcript on computer di sks for no or minimal charges.  The cost of scanning a 
transcript into electronic format at a la ter date, however, may be substantially higher.  
Transcripts in electronic format are in creasingly being used to analyze evidence using 
word and phrase searches  on specific topics.  Such use is beneficial when pr eparing 
the original ROI and reviewing evidence.  Whenever possible, contracts for court 
 I.9.b.  Written Statements 
I.9.b.1.  Format of Written Statements 
There are two main formats for written statem ents: narrative and question a nd 
answer (Q& A).  The Q& A format is good evidence of the fact that a statem ent was 
freely given since it record s the questio ns asked and  the replies given.  It leaves little 
ground for misinterpretations or claims th at important information given the IO has 
been omitted.  The Q&A format is generally most satisfactory when the issues are 
controversial or involved.  Often, written statements will end in the Q&A format 
after the witness has given an initial statemen t in n arrative format.  The narrative 
format is a practical and effective way to take a statement in whi ch the witn ess is 
asked simply to recount what happened chr onologically.  The IO should be prepared 
to ask questi ons after the narrative is comp lete tha t clarify or expand areas in  the 
narrative.   
In addition to all informa tion relevant to  the cause of the incident, the written 
statem ent sh ould contain the following (See Appendix 3 for an example written 
statem ent): 
•Place and da te the statem ent was taken; 
•The full name, address, phone numbers, and social security nu mber of the 
witness, alon g with acknowledgment that the IO h as provided the witness 
with a Privacy Act s tatem ent; 
•A statement at the end of the testim ony indicating the witness h as read the 
written sta tement and fin ds it a true representation of his or her testimony. 
The witness’ signature on the last pa ge and initials on every other page. 
Page numbers in the format “Page __ of ___ pages.”  
I.9.b.3.  Refusal to Sign Written Statements 
If a witness refuses to sign a written st atemen t extr acted from h is or her oral 
testimony, th e IO should place an add endum at th e end of the s tatem ent to the effect reporting services should include a requi rement for production of a copy of the 
transcript on a 3 ½ ” high density computer disks in ASCII data format or on a 
compact disc.   
Written statements are permanent official records of the testim ony of comp lainants, 
witnesses, an d subjects interviewed during an investigation.  Oral statem ents from 
witnesses or subjects that have evidenti ary weight sh all be transcribed or summarized 
as soon as possible after the interview.  This is particularly important if the statements 
are derogatory.  The IO should never make  reference to a written statem ent until 
after completion of the oral testimony.  The statem ent is one of the IO’s mos t
valuable tools, and care will be exercised to develop all material matters therein.   
I.9.b.2.  Contents of Written Statements 
•A statement from the witness that the testimony is  given voluntarily; 
 that it was read to or by the maker, w ho admitted the contents were true bu t refused 
to sign the statement.  Where possible, the IO should have another person who was 
also present while the sta tement was r ead sign the addendum as  well.  The addendum 
should also contain the wi tness’s reason for refusing to sign when it can be 
discovered.   
I.9.c.  Letter in Lieu of a Statement 
In some cases, IOs may be unable to o btain written  statem ent b ecause witn esses are 
no longer available for in person interviews.  In such cases, the IO may accept a letter 
containing th e pertinent i nformation in lieu of a written sta tement.  IOs should advise 
witnesses wri ting letters to ensure they contain th e same information required in a 
written sta tement, along with answers  to specific questions the IO may provide.

INVESTIGATING 
OFFICER’S NOTES ON 
THE INTERVIEWAny information that is not be included in the official record of  the investigation are 
considered ‘investigator’s notes.’  This can be in the form of ‘sticky notes,’ notes on 
legal pads, etc.  Investigator’s notes should be properly disposed of following the 
closure of an investigation. 
In cases bein g considered by the Distri ct Command er and/or the DOJ for criminal 
prosecution, investigator's notes may b e subject to " Discovery" a s items of 
evidentiary value and ther efore should be retained u ntil otherwise directed by DOJ 
and/or appropriate Coas t Guard legal counsel. 
J.OTHER INFORMATION

use them as checklists.  Interviews an d lines of questioning should be kept to those 
areas deem ed relevant on  their face.  
J.2.POST

CLASSIFICATION OF 
INFORMATIONThe factual information that is gathered will be classified into three categor y types.

Actions:  Thing s people do.  If a person is not involved, then the classifica tion

arrangements with the other vessel.] 
Events:  Things that ha ppen to peo ple and thi ngs.  An event occurs when a non-
living thing does some kind of action or when something happens to a either a non-
living thing or a person.  [Examples:  (1) The vessel went aground.  (2) The m an fell

B.1.FUNDAMENTAL 
PRINCIPLES OF 
CAUSAL ANALYSIS 
(UNDERLYING 
FOUNDATION) Marine investigators shall keep the following fundamental princi ples in mind when 
explaining how a specific accident o ccurred: 
Principle #1 : Shipping, diving, oil exploration, fishing, towing, fuel transfers, 
passenger operations, and recreational boa ting are complex production systems.
These production system s do not crea te new cars or refrigerators; instead they 
produce intangibles such as safe passenger voya ges, timely delivery of oil, and so on.  A.GENERATING A TIMELINE
The most basic element of conducting a ma rine investigation is telling the story of 
what happ ened.  During the initial stages of  every investigation, marine investigators 
should gather and record all the facts that may assist in determin ing causes.  They 
should be aware of the dangers of reaching  conclusions too early, thereby failing to 
keep an open mind.  It is recommend ed that the fa ct-finding step of the marine 
investigation process be kept separate from the ana lysis of the collected evid ence 
leading to conclusions and recommen dations.  The objective of the fact-finding step 
of the investigation is to collect as man y facts as po ssible regarding the accident and 
the actions/ events/conditions surrounding it .  The scope of any investigation may be 
divided into four areas: people (livewa re); environment; equip ment (hardware); and 
procedures (software). 
Condition:  Existing circumstance s or state of being.   Conditions may describe a 
person, place, or thing.  [Examples: (1) Th e shaft b earing was missing a safety guard.  
(2) Policy did not exist.  (3) The man was fatigued. (4) The mas ter has 10 years of 
sailing experience.] 
This is the chronological or dering of what occurred.  This is where the mar ine 
investigator determines the order with regard to who did wha t, what happ ened, or 
what conditi on existed at a particular time or over a period of time.  This is the 
information that generates measurable da ta from which trends a nd preventative 
measures may be derived.

 within the system itself.  They are the active  failures and LUCs originating in each of 
the five elem ents of production. 
B.3.b.1.  Active Failures  
“Began a turn into the ch annel (the action) with an  inaccurate mental pictu re of the 
vessel’s location (hazard). ”
“Decided no t to evacua te the pumpro om (the deci sion) despite the presence of toxic 
gas (hazard). ”
Active failures described as an action take n or decision made can be found in the 
actions list o f the timeline in the Findings of Fact in a MISLE Incident Investigation. 
B.3.b.2.  Latent Unsafe Conditions (LUCs) 
“Fatigued,” rather than “ decided to stay up late wa tching movies despite earl y 
watch.” 
“Worn,” rather than “not properly mainta ined” or “not replaced on schedule.” 
“Inadequate design,” rath er than “mistakes during design.” 
LUCs can be found in the conditions list of the tim eline in the Findings of Fact in a 
MISLE Incident Investigation. Active Failures  are unsafe acts and d ecisions committed in the presence of a hazard 
(condition).  Generally sp eaking, we are the most in terested in a ctive failures 
committed b y line workers during operations  (i.e., in the production and defense 
elements of the system ).  Unsafe acts a nd decisions are human er rors.  Most often, 
active failures have an im mediate imp act on safety.  The following are examples of 
active failures: 
Latent Unsafe Conditi ons(LUCs) are hazardo us conditions in the system that lie 
dormant, often for years, only becomi ng evident when they co mbine with a n unsafe 
act or decisi on to becom e an active fa ilure resulting in a negative outcome (event).  
Often they a rise from decisions made far from the accident s cene and, at th e time, 
were believed to be good or necessary.  LUCs should describe the condition of the 
system arising  from a fallible decision or action,  rather than the decision or action 
itself.  For instance:

B.4.a.  Identify the Initiating Event 
One of the most difficult aspects of a ny inve stigation is identifying the aspects of an 
accident you are trying to ex plain.  For the purposes of analyzing the causes of an 
accident, ma rine investigators must car efully identify the Initiati ng Event.  While a 
variety of actions, events, and conditions will precede an accid ent, a point must be 
chosen at which the accident is considered to start.   The marine investigator will 
initially focus on explaining how the accident  began, and will then turn to ex plaining 
how it progressed.  For the purposes of analyzing the causes of  an acciden t, the 
Initiating Event is simply the first unwanted or neg ative outcom e in the timel ine In 
marine casua lties the Initi ating Event may not  be the first “reportable” event.  In 
many cas es, the reportabl e event follows the Initiating Event and (when expl ained) 
sheds more light on the causes of the accide nt.  See the flowch art titled, “Part 1: 
Identify the I nitiating Event, Subsequent Events, & Failed Defenses,” in B.6 below. 
B.4.b.  Identify the Subsequent Events and Failed 
Defenses that Allowed them to Occur 
After identifying the Initiating Event.  The next step is to identify the Subsequent 
Events, which are the un wanted ev ents that originate from and  follow the initiating 
event.  Next,  to explain how the a ccident progressed from the Initiating Event into 
all the subsequent events , the marine investigator must identify the defensive failures 
that conn ect one event into another.  Thes e are the defenses on a vessel or platform 
arising AFTER the Initia ting Event (i.e. given the Initiating Event occurred, what 
defenses wo uld have prevented the n ext Subsequent Event; an d so on).   Engineered defenses dea ctivated

NOTE:  Upon identifying viable  failed defenses th roughout the Model of 
Production, the next logical step is to c onclude that they are n ecessary, and finally, 
recommend their implementation.  This displays how vital this step is throughout. 
B.4.f.  Identify the Workplace Factors and Failed 
Defenses 
Once the preconditions have been identified, the marine investigator should focus on 
the management environment to d etermine how and why th e preconditions were 
created.  Marine investigators should also be careful to consider the absen ce of 
management in addition to pro-active management.  Marine investigators are 
cautioned to remember th at the line m anager’s ability to man age is limited by their 
available resources.  For this reason, it is  important to carefully recognize th e causal Once th e marine investigator has identi fied the activ e failures in production, they 
must ask “In what conditi on did the p erson (Liveware), Software, Hardware, and/or 
Environment (SHEL) ha ve to be for them/it to fai l?”  Preconditions create the 
potential for a wide variety of active failu res.  Marin e investigators should aga in 
remember th at they may encounter a la rge nu mber of latent uns afe (pre)con ditions.  
For instance, a given mariner may hav e had LUCs of fatigue, drug use, and an 
aggressive attitude.  In this case, it ma y be difficult to ascertain exactly which 
precondition has a causal connection to th e production active fa ilure.  Marine 
investigators should record all preconditions internal to a person as having a causal 
connection.  Similarly, they may be tempted  to “weigh” a given precondition over 
another (i.e., fatigue was more important than dru g use or attitude).  Marine 
investigators should not give opinions as to the relative strength of various 
preconditions in their causal connectio n to a given production active failure without 
significant scientific basis for those opi nions.  See the flowchart titled, “Part 2: 
Identify Pro duction, Unsafe Acts/Decisions, Prec onditions, & Failed Defenses,” in 
B-7 below. 
Once th e marine investigator has com pleted the pr evious steps, they have id entified 
the active failures in pro duction that occurred.  Such active fai lures occur 
constantly in  complex sys tems.  However, re latively few result in accidents.  When a 
system’s defenses were su fficient to detect an  active failure and prevent the a ccident, 
a “near miss ” is said to have occurred (though “near hit” may be a more ap propriate 
term).  In order to explain an acciden t, marine investigators must identify the defense 
factor failures that allowed the active f ailure to progress into an accident.  Many faults 
may be discovered in the system’s defens es, only some of which will be causally 
connected to  the producti on active failures and the accident.  Failed defenses should 
eventually be identified for all elements  of the Model of Production.

determining the Workplace Factors, identify any failed defenses.  See the flowchart

B.4.g.  Identify the Organization Factors and Failed 
Defenses 
The basic idea underlying the causal anal ysis system (and the IM O documents upon 
which it is ba sed) is that s ystem a ccide nts have their primary origins in fallible 
decisions made by designers and high-level  decision makers.  Marine investigators, 
having identified workplace LUCs, should identify the conditio ns to which the line 
managers were responding.  Decision makers’ fallible decisions create LUCs that 
affect line managers.  Marine investigators s hould bear in mind that decision makers 
rarely have direct access to the conseq uences of th eir decisions, and may be almost 
entirely unaware of the LUCs they have created.  Upon determining the Organization 
Factors, identify any failed defenses.  See the flowchart titled, “Part 3: Identify 
Workplace and Organization Factors & Failed Defenses,” in B.8 below.

 marine investigator has is identifying the types or k inds of human errors that occur 
and be better  able to mak e effective reco mmenda tions to chang e unwanted behavior.  
As human er ror is analyzed, it may em erge that certain errors relate principally to 
specific preconditions.  It may also em erge that certain errors are harder or 
impossible to defend against.  These relationships determine what safety 
recommenda tions are ma de and what impr ovements the Coast Guard undertakes. 
C.1.b.  Reason’s Generic Error Modeling System (GEMS) 
In his 1990 book “Human Error,” Dr . James Reas on integrated  two bodies of 
thought on human error into a single framework referred to as the Generic Error 
Modeling Sy stem (GEM S).  GEMS differs from previous error analysis tool s in that it 
integrates th e errors that occur at all levels of performance.  In creating the annex to 
the Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties  and Inciden ts, the IMO adopted 
GEMS as the preferred tool for investigat ing human performance.  The Coast Guard 
has also ado pted this too l. 
One of the most challen ging aspects of acci dent i nvestigation is describing exactly 
what type of errors the people involved made and why they ma de them.  To
accomplish this, marine investigators need to have a thorough understanding of how 
people solve problems and perform tasks.  In orde r to fully understand how people 
perform tasks and solve problems, it will be  necessary to describe Rasmussen’s skills, 
rules, and knowledge (SRK) model of human performance. 
C.3.HOW PEOPLE 
SOLVE PROBLEMS AND 
PERFORM TASKSC.3.a.  General 
Dr. James Reason analyzes human error usi ng the Generic Error Modeling System 
(GEMS), which is based on the work of hi s mentor, Dr. Rasmussen.  The work of 
Dr. Rasmussen explores how people solve problem s and do things.  It identifies three 
levels of performance and  suggests that the kind of human error a person makes 
depends on the level of performance in which they were engaged at the tim e.  In 
1981, Dr. Ro use succinctly summarized a co mmon theme in psychology: “people are 
furious pattern matchers. ”  As such, the human mi nd attemp ts to find patter ns and 
select a “pre-packaged” action rather than analyze each situatio n and calcula te the 
optimal solution.  In 1986, drawing on th is observation, Dr. Rassmusen identi fied 
three levels of human performance.  They are: 1) skill-based performance (SB); 2) 
rule-based performance (RB); and knowledge-based performance (KB). 
C.3.b.  The Lowest Level of Performance: Skill-Based C.2.INTRODUCTION 
TO MODEL OF HUMAN 
PERFORMANCE
Usually human functioning is skill-ba sed (SB).  In SB performance, the task is so 
automatic and the surroundings so fa miliar that the person doesn’t think about how 
to do it.  The person merely mentally vi sualizes the desired state and it happens, 
largely without conscious monitoring.  Unless we are very new to these activities, we 
do not have to consciousl y consider how to perform them, or focus atten tion on 
them.  All th e person mu st monitor is how well (a nd how far) the activity is 
progressing.  When it’s gone far enough, th e person turns the a utomatic fun ction off.  
Accordingly, SB performance requires  that th e pers on pay sufficient attentio n, at the 
 Complex situations or activities cannot be solely dealt with th rough automatic 
functions.  While we al most always start in SB performance, people switch up to the 
next level wh en an attenti on check detects a deviati on from the “pre-packaged” or 
planned-for conditions.  Usually the discrepancy is minor and correction is found 
early, so people return to SB performance.  Our daily routines largely consist of SB 
performance with periodic shifts to an d from the next level: rule-based performance. 
Most people don’t recognize that they ha ve an enormous “library” of rules fo r 
dealing with every day life, most of which they wou ld have difficulty describing in 
words.  People acquire some of these r ules from formal educatio n, but most a re 
learned from experience.  When peopl e detec t that SB performance isn’t wor king or 
won’t work, they try to figure out the situati on.  They look for “signs” or indicators.  
This is rule-based (RB) performance.  RB performance has two parts: (1) the 
perception r ule (if you see sign X, then state of the world Y exists); and (2) the action 
rule (if state of the world Y exists, then action Z is  appropriate).  To select the right 
rule and solve the problem, a person in RB performance must select and us e the right 
perception a nd action rules. 
As stated before, people a re furious pattern matchers, meaning they look at the signs 
and match s tored rules until they find one that fits.  Because situ ations are co mplex, 
slight differences between situations ma y require different solutions.  Typically, 
people disco ver this by trying a rule that  seems to fit, and monitoring how well it 
works.  When one rule fails to solve the pr oblem even when it appeared to fit the 
situation, people tend to look for a nother rule, usually closely related. 
If we have a rule that fits, we use the “ prepackaged” answer: if you see sign X, then 
state of the world Y is true.  If state of th e world Y is true, then do Z.  The action Z 
is often simply a skill.  For example, take the simple act of adjusting the temperature 
of a bath.  If the water feels hot to the hand  (sign), the water is too hot (sta te of the 
world).  If the water is to o hot (sta te of the world), turn on cold water (SB action). 
Although we spend most of our time in SB performance, we ra rely have mu ch 
conscious memory of that performance.  With enormous practice and experience, a 
rule-based activity (even v ery complex RB activity) can be “pushed” below th e 
conscious threshold and become SB.. right times or else the automatic function may go too far.

the person in tends to do one thing, but does another).  When a person fails to 
execute th e plan they ha ve in mind, an execution error has occurred. 
C.5.b.1.  Analysis Check: SB Performance? 
If a person does somethi ng other tha n what th ey intended to d o, the person  must be 
using relatively little conscious resources, or in  SB performance.  If a person is not in The first step in conducti ng human error analysis is to identify which act or decision 
to analyze from the actio ns list on the time line in the Findings of Fact in a MISLE 
Incident Investigation.  During the course  of a typical acciden t, many decis ions are 
made and actions taken.  Of those, many will prove to have been errors.  Using the 
processes ou tlined in Enclosures 2 and 3, each actio n and decisio n shall be separated 
and organized within the model of production.   As a general guideline, if there is 
difficulty conducting human error analysis, then it is likely that several acts or 
decisions are being analyzed as one.   
Example: The decision  not to wear a life jacket on a cruise ship while underway, for 
instance, (bel ow decks with limited opportunities to reach the edge) is not an unsafe 
decision because there is no hazard.  Deciding not to wear a life jacket in a small 
vessel while working near the edge or over the side, however, is an unsafe decision. 
For the purposes of human error analysis, listing or analyzing all the errors or mis-
actions a per son commits  serves no purpose.  Instead, focus should be placed upon 
those errors and mis-actions that are Unsafe Acts or Decisio ns.  To do so, the 
hazard must be clearly identified in w hose presence the error or mis-action was 
performed.  If the hazard  cannot be id entified, then the error/mis-action does not 
qualify as an unsafe act or  decision, and do es not require further attention.  Hazards 
are latent un safe conditions (LUCs) iden tified in preconditions or defense. 
The second step in analyzing human error requires a decision a s to wheth er the 
person’s error was in the execution or planni ng of t he action or decision.  Execution 
errors involv e memory failures and attenti on errors, whereas planning errors involve 
mistakes and  violations.   
 SB performance, an execution error was not com mitted. 
C.5.b.2.  Analysis Check: More than One Unsafe Act or 
Decision? 
In some cases, it will appear that a pers on made an execution error, but was in RB 
performance.  As an example: A mariner ma y be navigating using the navigation rules 
(RB-performance), panic and turn to p ort.  In these cases there a re two separ ate 
errors: (1) the RB unsafe decision that led to the m ariner panic; and (2) the S B unsafe 
act of pushing the rudder to port instead of to starboard.  When it appears that a 
person made an executio n error, but was in RB performance, the situation s hould be 
examined further. 
C.5.c. Planning Errors 
A Planni ng Error  is a mistake or violation that res ults when th e person executes a 
decision or action as they intended, bu t that a ction was inappropriate for the 
situation.  Planning errors are the opposite of execution errors.  The error lies not in 
how the plan  was executed, but in the plan itself. 
Because plan ning errors involve moderate to high a mounts of conscious acti vity 
(decisions and problem solving), all planning errors occur in RB or KB performance.  
If the person was engaged in SB performa nce, the error is an execution error. 
C.6.EXECUTION 
ERROR 
CATEGORIZATION :
ATTENTION OR 
MEMORY By definition, all execution errors are e rrors in SB performance.  However, the 
person does have to periodically interrupt the prepr ogrammed behaviors to check on 
the progress of the activity.  These “at tention checks” establish (1) wheth er the 
actions are r unning according to plan; and (2) whether the preprogrammed sequence 
is still adequate to achiev e the desired outcome.  In essence, the person checks for 
deviations from his or her expectation s.  Execution errors occur when something 
goes wrong with the peri odic atten tion checks.  Specifically, attention check s may go 
wrong because the perso n pays attention at the wr ong time, pays insufficient 
attention, or completely f orgets to perf orm the attention check.  In analyzing 
execution errors, it shall be determined  whether th e error involved a problem with 
attention or a problem with memory.
Attention Failures  are execution errors that occu r because the person’s cognitive 
“radar screen” or attenti on is directed elsewh ere, leading them  to fail to perform an 
attention check or to make errors in the atten tion check (i.e., any form of distraction 
may initiate a n atten tion failure). C.5.c.1.  Analysis Check: Rule or Knowledge-Based 
Performance? 
C.6.a.  General 
C.6.b.  Attention Failure  
C.6.b.1.  Analysis Check: Did the Person Remember the 
Plan? 
 When it is suspected that a person had  an atten tion failure, the analysis should be 
checked by v erifying that the person remembered what attention  checks they were to 
make, and when they wer e to be mad e.  An attention failure involves failing to make 
these ch ecks or mistiming them despite a clea r memory of the need to do s o.  If the 
person mom entarily forgot what they were do ing, this is a memory failure, n ot an 
attention fail ure. 
Memory Fa ilures  are ex ecution errors that occur because th e person’s memory is 
faulty, leading them to forget to perform an atten tion check, or to make erro rs in the 
attention check, such as forgetting what one  is loo king for (often referred to in 
today’s cultu re as “a senior moment”). 
When a memory failure is suspected, the analysis i s verified by identifying the key 
piece of information that the person forgot.  Examples of key pieces of information 
include the n eed to ch eck the progress of an action, or specific signs that the task is 
not accomplishing its purpose.  Peopl e often view memory failures as more 
unprofessional than an attention failure, an d claim they rememb ered all the k ey items, 
but simply didn’t pay that much attenti on to a key item, when in fact, more often 
people have forgotten to look at that i tem. 
C.7.PLANNING 
ERROR 
CATEGORIZATION :
MISTAKE OR 
VIOLATIONWhen an uns afe act or decision results from a failure in the pers on’s plan (rather than 
their executi on of the plan), the problem with the plan originates in one of two ways.  
In the usual case, the person intends a positive outcome (i.e., they want to solve the 
problem and choose a good plan).  In some unusual cases, however, the person 
willfully brea ks rules in order to attain a positive outcome or for malicious purposes.  
In analyzing planning errors, it must be determined whether th e person’s plan was 
faulty becaus e they m ade a mistake wh ile tryi ng to solve the problem accordi ng to the 
rules or because they kno wingly violated rules. 
C.7.b.  Mistakes 
Practically speaking, all planning errors are errors in problem solving.  A problem is 
any situation  that requires  a person to revise their current line of action.  As 
previously discussed, people have a str ong bi as to search for and find a prepackaged 
solution to problems (i.e., use of RB performance) before resorting to the m ore 
mentally intense solution from first princi ples (i.e., use of KB performance).  A 
mistake  is a failure in detecting and using rules, or in solving problems from first 
principles. 
When a pers on deliberately violates rules or plans, the person is committing a 
violation rather than a m istake.  Acco rdingl y, if it is determined  that th e pers on was C.6.c.  Memory Failure 
C.6.c.1.  Analysis Check: Was Key Information Missing? 
C.7.a.  General 
C.7.b.1.  Analysis Check: Aware of Applicable Rules or 
Plans? 
 consciously a ware of a rule or plan app licable to the situation, but did somethi ng else, 
the unsafe act or decision should be classified as a violation. 
NOTE :  Natural human behavior is to rationalize past mistakes.  For whatever 
reason, witnesses often find it embarrassing to admit that they simply did not know 
what to do, or that their plans were fund amentally flawed.  Instead, they will often 
rationalize th at they were aware of app licable  rules or plans, but made an err or in 
judgment.  Extreme cauti on should be used in relying solely upon a mariner’s own 
testimony a bout their decisions.  Instead, an evalua tion of the m ariner’s general level 
of knowledge and experience should be made.  From this evaluation, the mar iner’s 
likely awaren ess of the rules or plans applicable to the situation may be inferred. 
C.7.c.  Violations 
A violation  is a deliberate decision to break established rules, procedures, or plans 
that are appli cable to a sp ecific problem regardless of the reason . 
C.7.c.1.  Analysis Check:  Specific Intended Actions 
Clear? 
In many cases a plan, rule, or procedure w ill exist in order to deal with a specific 
problem (e.g.:  Shipboard Oil Pollution Emer gency Plan).  The plans, protocols, or 
rules are often vague in regard to specific actions.  In order to qualify as a violation, 
the person must deliberately decide to viol ate the specified acti on.  If no action is 
specified (i.e., the action i s up to the marine r’s judgment), the unsafe act or  decision is 
more likely a mistake  than a violation . 
C.7.d.  Types of Planning Errors 
As previously discussed, people execute decisi ons primarily in SB performance, but 
they make th ose decisions in RB or KB performance.  Violatio ns are deliberate 
decisions to depart from legitimate problem solving.  Mistakes are mis-performances 
of legitimate RB and KB problem solving.  Depending on the type of problem, a 
planning error may occur  in either RB-performance or KB-performance.  Generally 
speaking, people search furiously for RB solutions to a given problem.  In doing so, 
they (a ) match observations to a rule-based criteria , and (b) try the rule out.  When a 
particularly difficult problem arises, pe ople will try many rules, refining their 
observations and so on, trying to solve the problem.  In these cases, RB performance 
may fail, and the person may switch to KB performance.  Common examples of RB 
mistakes and  KB mistakes are listed below. 
The following informatio n details RB and KB mistakes. 
C.7.e.1.  RB Mistakes C.7.e.  Mistakes 
In any given problem or situation, rules can be tho ught of as competing for the right 
to represent the current s tate of the world (in the person’s mind).  In this wa y, the 
 The degree to which it “matches” th e salient featu res of the situation; 
The “strength” of the rule, which dep ends on the number of times the rule has 
performed successfully for a person in the past;  
The degree that the rule meshes or blends with other rules currently active in the 
person’s mind. 
Rules are organized according to a hierarchy beginning with the most genera l rule.  
Exceptions a nd special ca ses are organized beneath this top layer.  Problems in 
selecting a rule can arise a nywhere in this morass of general and specific rules 
competing for selection in a person’s mind.  For ease of organization, the common 
RB mistakes can be organized into (a) use  of a bad rule, and (b) misuse of a good 
rule. 
C.7.e.1.a.  Use of a Bad Rule 
A Bad Rule  is one where the rule itsel f is faul ty for some reason.  In this rega rd, 
because rules  have two pa rts (1) match ing the situation and (2) p roviding a line of 
action to sol ve the problem.  A bad rule may be fa ulty in either of these two areas.  
This section describes some common  mistakes bas ed on application of bad rules.  
C.7.e.1.b.  Misuse of a Good Rule 
A Good Rul eis a rule that has been p roven to be  useful in a particular situation.  
Nonetheless,  a person might choose the wrong rule for the situation becaus e two 
rules are available that ap pear to match the situatio n but have very different required 
actions.  This section dea ls with com mon mistakes people mak e selecting good rules 
that are wro ng for the situation. 
C.7.e.2.  KB Mistakes 
The human mind is a very powerful problem -solving machine capable of finding the 
“deep structure” of a problem (in KB-perfor mance).  In explaining the concept of 
deep structur e, Dr. Schank (1982) refers to the similar themes of Romeo and Juliet  and 
West Side Story .  These are two very different stories, one about R enaissance Italy, the 
other about gang warfare  in modern New Yo rk.  But on a deeper level, they share the 
same structu re.  To discover this similarity, howev er, a person must mentall y
summarize the plot lines and compare them – a K B-performance activity.   KB-
performance uses an enor mous amount of mental resources, is slow, and happens in 
sequence (as opposed to RB-perform ance, wer e many RB rules might be active at 
one time).  Perhaps even more frequently than with RB performance, people make 
mistakes whi le in KB-performance.  For ease  of organization, these mistakes can be 
organized into two ca tegories:  bias and heuristics. human mind  is a “parallel processor” in that several rules can be “active” at the same 
time and competing with one another.  A given rule’s success in winning in a person’s 
mind depend s on several factors, including: 
The specificity of the rule, meaning that the more s pecifically a rule describes the 
current situation, the more likely it is to win; and 
 C.7.e.2.a.  Heuristics 
A Heuristic is a mental “rule of thumb.”  People often resort to  the use of heuristics 
(mental rules  of thumb) that help them to diagnose problems without expending too 
much mental effort and thus too much time.  Often, these heur istics serve them well; 
however, they are shortcu ts and as such mariners may be shortchanging themselves 
of adequate and accurate information.  Rather than processing all available 
information and following reasoning to its most probable and l ogical end, taking of a 
shortcut may give a person a false understanding of the actu al situation.  Simply put, a 
heuristic is the mis-diagnosis or mis-reading of a novel situation. 
C.7.e.2.b.  Bias 
A Bias is the tendency to apply a certain respons e regardless of the situation.  Biases 
are fundamentally problems with how a person perceives the “p roblem space,” and 
what factors they choos e to pay attenti on to .  Simply put, a bias is an improper 
decision made (usually the same one) r egardless of what the novel situation may be. 
C.7.f.  Violations 
As a law enf orcement ag ency, men a nd women of the Coast G uard tend to think of 
violations as any departur e from binding law or regulation.  While planning errors of 
the violation type ma y in fact relate to l egal violations, marine investigators should 
not confuse the two while conducting  human error analysis.  Planning errors of the 
violation type are delibera te decisions to break esta blished rules, plans, or procedures.  
Only in some cases (no t all), those established rules, plans, or procedures ha ve the 
force of law (ex:  regulations, lawful orders, etc.).  This section describes the most 
common wa ys in which p eople deliberately break r ules, plans, or procedures.  
C.7.f.1.  Routine Adaptation 
Definitio n:  “Routine violations happen everyd ay as people regularly modify or do 
not strictly comply with work procedures , often because of poorly designed or 
defined work practices.  Two factors seem important in shaping a person’s routine 
violation behavior:  (a) the natural hu man ten dency to take the path of least effort; 
and (b) a rela tively indifferent or forgiving environment.  In everyday life, if the 
quickest and easiest wa y to do somethi ng involves violating an apparently tr ivial rule 
or procedure that is rarely enforced/sanctione d, people will routinely violate that rule.  
The presence of this type of violation often indicates that th e system itself could be 
better design ed, keeping the operator i n mind.”  [Reason:  196] 
Example :  Because land scape architects routinely lay out garden and park walkways 
on aesthetic grounds rather than according to how people will use the paths, people 
routinely violate the “stay on the paths ” rule in order to walk th e most direct route, 
leaving muddy diagonal tracks across the protected grassy areas. 
Summary :  The defining characteristi c of routine adaptation is  that: i) there is an 
easier action to take th an the prescribed acti on; ii) it is done with some frequency; and 
 Example :  At the Ch ernobyl site, safety regulatio ns were delib erately ignored and a 
safety test was carried to o far, ultimately re sulting in disaster. However, the goal of 
violating the safety regulations was not to commit a malevolent a ct, but actu ally to 
improve system safety thr ough the test. 
Summary :  The defining characteristi c of exceptio nal adaptatio n is that: i) it is the 
product of local conditions; ii) they ar e very infrequent; and iii) the goal is to improve 
the situation.
C.7.f.3.  Sabotage 
Definitio n:  “Sabotage is deliberately v iolating a rule, law, regulation, or work 
practice with  the knowled ge that and explicit purpose of causing damage.  In other 
words, the person commi ts a malevolent act.” [Rea son:  195-6] 
Example:   Engineers aboard the M/V ROTTER DAM, faced with mainten ance 
problems generating large volumes of oily bilge water, decided to build a pipe that 
bypassed the oily water separator and di scharged the oily bilge water directl y 
overboard, which is a knowing discharge of oil into the wa ters of the United States 
and is, therefore, a criminal offense.  The engineers were willing to violate these laws 
because th eir pay was bas ed on keepin g maintenan ce costs down in the engine room, 
and excessive operation of the oily water separato r would have enormously inflated 
spare part co sts (and driven bonuses d own dramati cally).  
Summary :  The defining characteristi c of sabotage is that the in tent is to cau se 
damage. 
C.8.
PRECONDITIONS 
LEADING TO HUMAN 
ERRORIn the final step of analyzing human error, the marine investigator considers the 
preconditions (related to the person) from the Caus al Analysis that combined with 
the unsafe act or decision resulted in the acciden t.  The many fa ctors weighing on the 
person will have been detected, record ed, an d organized during fact-finding using the 
SHEL model (see Figure B4-5).  In practi ce, however, the marine investigator must 
direct consid erable attenti on to explaining  in the Conclusions how one or many of 
the SHEL factors led to the human er ror.

FOLLOWING HUMAN 
ERROR ANALYSISC.9.a.  What do I do with the results of Human Error

C.7.f.2.  Exceptional Adaptation 
Definitio n:  “In contrast to routine violations, an exceptional violation tends  to be a 
one-time breach of a work practice.  Typically these less defined types of violation 
result from “system doubl e-binds” where it is impossible to follow one rule or 
procedure without violating another.”  [Reason:  196]

ELEMENTSB.2.a.  General A.GENERAL
IOs may not draw legal conclusions in an ROI.  Phraseology such as “Mr. Mitchell 
violated 33 CFR 124.4” or “Mr. Mitchell violated no law,” is to be strictly 
avoided .  With regard to violations, ROIs are to summarize factual information 
for presentation as evidence that a pers on or corporation may have violated a 
certain law o r regulation.  Final determi nations regarding possible violations are 
determined by Federal Courts, Administrati ve Law Judges, and Hearing Officers.  
Throughout this Volume,  the term violation will be used for the term ‘alleged’ 
violation. 
Step Five: Refer Violations for Appropriate Enforcement. 
B.STEP ONE:IDENTIFY LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN FORCE 
TO DETERMINE JURISDICTION
All laws and regulations are composed  of two basic sets of elem ents:  the 
jurisdictional elements go verning where and to who m the law ap plies; and the 
factual elements governing the acts or conditions involved.  To determine whether 
a given law or regulation was in force at the tim e of an incident, the IO must 
evaluate th e jurisdictional elements of that law or regulation. 
Jurisdictional elements are those facts a s defined in a statute that must exist before 
the federal government, including the Coa st Guard , can properly take action for 
violation of that statu te.  Jurisdiction is generally limited in ter ms of specific people 
or organizations, specific geographical locations, or specific subject ma tter. 
 B.2.b.  Jurisdiction over a Person or Organization 
B.2.c.  Jurisdiction over Geographical Locations 
Jurisdiction over a person or organization is frequently limited by means of the 
person’s geographic location at the ti me of the in cident.  Most of the laws and 
regulations enforced on foreign entities (f oreign ve ssels, merchant seamen, owners 
and operator s) apply only on the U.S. territorial sea, for instance.  Another 
particularly important ex ample is that ma ny federa l criminal laws that th e Coast 
Guard enforces are only applicable in what is known as the “S pecial Maritime and 
Territorial Jurisdiction” (SMTJ).  See Section G.2 b elow, 18 USC 7, and 33 CFR 
2.05-1(b).  In determining whether a gi ven regulation or statute was in force, IOs 
must assure that the statute applies at the geographic location where the inci dent 
occurred.  Key elements to consider include wheth er the inciden t occurred: 
•Entirely on the internal waters of a sta te; 
•On the Grea t Lakes; 
•On a federal reservation; 
•On the navigable waters of the United States 
•Within the territorial sea 
•On or in connection with the Outer C ontinental S helf; and 
B.2.d.  Jurisdiction over Subject Matter 
B.3.FACTUAL 
ELEMENTSJurisdiction over a person or organization must be established  by demonstrating 
that the pers on or organization in questi on was governed by th e law or regulation 
in question at the tim e of the incident.  Most statutes enumerate the roles of 
specific individuals or organizations to which it applies, as owner, operator, 
master, pilot, person in charge, etc.  In determining whether a gi ven regulation or 
statute was i n force, IOs must assure th at the statute applies to the people or 
organizations involved. 
•Within the Exclusive Economic Zone.
Jurisdiction over a person or organization is  also frequently limited by means of 
the operatio ns being performed.  Many statutes, for instance, ap ply only while a 
given operation, such as transfer of bulk oil products, is ongoing.  In determining 
whether a gi ven regulation or statute was in  force, IOs must as sure that the statute 
applies to sp ecific subject matter involved. 
Factual elem ents are thos e facts as def ined in a statute that esta blish a 
circumstance, event, or action as it actually  takes or took place.  Factual elem ents 
in statutes an d regulations may either s pecify required actions or  conditions, or 
may forbid an action or condition.  Factual elemen ts are not rel evant in 
determining whether a la w or regulation was in force; instead th ey determin e
whether a vi olation occur red.

INTRODUCTION
C.2.PROOF OF 
PERSON INVOLVEDEvidence of the individual’s role as owner, operator, or person directing the 
movement o f the vessel is extremely i mportant.  It is important to have evid ence 
in the file as to who the a ctual owner/ operator of the vessel wa s at the tim e of the 
violation.   Examples of proof of iden tify can include but are n ot limited to:
•Copy of vessel’s documentation; 
•Copies of vessel’s log entries/ship’s papers; 
•Copies of a person’s license (if required for the job they were 
performing); or  
C.3.
IDENTIFICATIONC.3.a.  Address and Phone 
C.3.b.  Vessel Official Numbers 
C.3.c.  Property Ownership Records C.STEP TWO:IDENTIFY PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS 
INVOLVED
To establish jurisdiction over a person or organization, the IO must accurately 
identify who was involved.  Further, fo r any subsequent enforcement action to be 
effective con tact information for that person or organization m ust be compl ete 
and accurate. 
•A witness’ statemen t as to the role of the individuals on board.
Locating and providing a current address and phone number for an 
owner/operator can be di fficult, partic ularly when dealing with abandoned v essels, 
smaller commercial fishing vessels, etc.  Consider the resources  in this sectio n for 
detailing the person or organization culpable.
State and Of ficial Numbers can be tra ced back thr ough state b oating law 
administrators or MIS LE.
Culpable individuals can often be identified by determining the vessel/facility 
owners/operators, marina operators, harbor masters, customers, and owners of the 
property on which aband oned vessels are located.  Many of these records ca n be 
found through state boating law administrators or MISLE. 
C.4.
CORPORATIONS AND 
SUBSIDIARIESThe legal relationship between corpor ations, divisions, and subsidiaries can be 
extremely co mplex.  In determining who the involved person or organization is, 
IOs must be sensitive to these comple x relationships.  While MISLE contains 
some of this “parent-child” information, IOs should refer to external resources 
including Data Universal Numbering System Num bers ( DUNS Number ). The 
DUNS Number is Dunn & Bradstreet's distinctive nine-digit identification 
sequence. Th e DUNS Number is an internationally recognized common com pany 
identifier in global electronic commerce transacti ons.  Since each location of a 
business may have its own unique DUNS Number, a large orga nization is likely to 
have many d ifferent DUNS Numbers within its corporate "family." DUNS

million corporate family members around the world.  The DUNS number is 
unique identifier that should be captur ed in the MISLE party details for the 
organization, it is also extremely useful for the collection of debt. 
D.STEP THREE:CONSIDER HUMAN ERROR
Human error is a predictable part of th e Marine Transportation System.  When 
performing violation analysis, the IO must be alert to human er rors such as:  1) an 
act expressly prohibited in a law or regulation; and/or 2) an act of professional 
incompeten ce, misconduct, or negligence.  The ter m “human error” applies to a 
wide variety of human behaviors, as describe d in Chapter B4 of this volume.  Skill-
based errors, for instance, are significantl y different from knowledge-based errors.  
Human error encompasses decisions and actions.  In some insta nces, the a ction 
performed in error (unintended or willful) will be directly prohibited by law or 
regulation.  In such cases,  regardless of intent, the error should be treated as a 
violation of that regulation or law.  The intent of th e person involved, however, is 
relevant in assessing the appropriate level of enforcement.  See Part C of this 
Volume. 
Most casualti es involve some form of human errors.  In determining if the human 
rise to the level of negligence IO’s sh ould look to the definition of negligence in 
46 CFR 5.29:  Negligence  is the commiss ion of an act which a reas onable and 
prudent person of the sa me station, u nder the sam e circumstan ces, would not 
commit, or the failure to perform an act which a reasonable and  prudent person of 
the same s tation, under the same circu mstances, would not fail to perform. 
 D.3.b.  Further Research on Negligence 
•IOs should be aware of th e following in evaluating whether hu man error 
constitutes n egligence: 
•The presumption of negligence arises when a vessel grounds on a 
submerged object even if the precise l ocation is unknown (CDOA 2113; 
HINDS).  
•Vessels are p resumed not to run aground in the ordinary course when 
operated by careful navigators (CDOA 1200; RIC HARDS) 
•When a vess el grounds in a place where it has no business being under the 
commonly a ccepted dicta tes of piloting and good seamanship, the 
presumption of fault arise s on the part of the person piloting. (CDOA 
2133; SAND LIN CDOA 2382; NI LSEN  CDOA 2409 
PLACZKIEWICZ) 
A “Strong” presumption of negligence aris es when evidence is  submitted that the 
respondent was operatin g a vessel which struck a stationary obj ect: 
•When a drifting vessel or vessel under its own power allides with an 
anchored ves sel or a navigational st ructure, the burden of proving the 
absence of fa ult or inevitable accident rests with th e moving vessel.  
(Schoenbau m, Thomas J. ADMIRALTY AND M ARITIME LAW sect. 
13-2) 
D.3.c.  Gross Negligence•In CDOA 2 217 (QUIN N), Commandant uphel d an administrative law 
judge (ALJ) finding of negligence, in th at as operator of a tow with barges, 
the respondent failed to navigate the tow so as to “preclude the barges she 
was pushing from collidin g with variou s moored vessels.  The 
Commandant held that “allisions of th e sort which occurred in this case do 
not ordinarily occur unles s the vessel h as been mis managed in some way”.  
Gross negligence is the hi ghest form of  negligence, in which a conscious or 
voluntary act is performed in reck less disregard of both legal duty and 
consequences.  While gross negligence is  commonly used to refer to instances 
where a pers on has taken  no care, it a ctually is a failure to take the minimu m (i.e., 
non-expert) precautions an ordinary person would take.

D.7.
SUBSTITUTION TESTWhen an action, intentional or not, error or  not, violates a duly established rule, 
that action is misconduct.   While most commonly associated with willful, 
voluntary, and intentional  actions by a person such as intoxication or failure t o 
join, misconduct need no t include these elements.  NOTE:   Often in the 
Suspension and Revocati on (S&R) process, cases might involve both misco nduct 
and a violation of law.  IO’s should cont act their servicing legal office if in doubt 
about a  particular charge,.  See Part C of this Volume for more information. 
When an action, intentional or not, error or not, demonstrates that a creden tial 
holding mariner lacks even the basic k nowledge and skills required to obtain that 
credential, th at act should  be considered a violation.  In considering human error 
as professional incompetence, the IO m ust rely upon the credential issuing 
standards of the credential-issuin g government and the internati onal STCW 
provisions. 
In performing violation analysis, the IO must also be alert for specific actio ns 
which a mari ner or other person:  1) was explicitly required to perform by law or 
regulation, but which they failed to perfor m; or 2) was required by standards  of 
professional competence,  formalized (non- regulatory) rule, or accepted stan dards 
of attention to duty, but which they f ailed to perform.  In these cases, the failure to 
take an action or make a judgment may be considered a violation, just as taking an 
action would .
The ‘substitution test’ is conducted to d etermine if a specific act or decision is 
something th at any perso n of the sam e station (sa me position, qualifications, etc.) 
would do in the same situ ation.  This in volves asking a person of the same station 
that if given the same prevailing circu mstances (conditions, type and size of vessel, 
operation, etc.) what they would do.  This should be conducted in an ‘open-ended’ 
fashion without providing information as to exactl y what ha ppened or using a 
“would you do this – yes or no?” questioning tech nique.  After  receiving 
information about what the person of the same s tation would do, then you may 
state wh at actually happened and ask if th e person of the same station woul d have 
done the sa me.

 D.8.b.  Human Error to Offense Matrix 
The following Human Error to Offense Matrix is provided to assist the IO  in 
ensuring that the human error analysis and vi olation analysis are consistent.  If the 
results differ, one of the a nalysis processes may need to be reviewed/revised.  This 
also assists by identifying which offense a given error might rise  to.  The IO is 
cautioned th at not all errors are offe nses, and this matrix sugge sts no such 
automatic co rrelation.

Once th e analysis is complete, violations should be referred for enforcement 
evaluation and appropriate action.  The ROI SHOULD NOT CONCLUDE that 
a violation did or did not occur.  Instead, having met the thres holds for evidence 
suggested above, the IO should report only that th ere is evidence of the specific 
violation warranting further enforcement evaluation . 
As a matter of policy, IOs will document all notifications of violations from the 
public in a MISLE notification record.  Otherwise, when a viola tion is detected

F.2.SPECIAL 
MARITIME AND 
TERRITORIAL 
JURISDICTIONF.2.a.  General 
F.2.b.  Definition 
The SMTJ term is a challenge to define clearly and a ccurately in a ll circumstances.  
For the purposes of this section, the f ollowing guidelines define the SMTJ.  The 
SMTJ applie s to: 
•A U.S. flag vessel outside the jurisdicti on of any sta te (sea ward o f the U.S. 
territorial sea), including such vessels located in foreign waters; 
•A U.S. flag vessel located on the wa ters of the Grea t Lakes or any of the 
waters conn ecting them; 
•Lands within exclusive federal jurisdic tion on federal reservations, as well 
as land outside the jurisdiction of an y nation (e.g., Antarctica) with respect 
to an offense by or against a national of the U.S.; 
•U.S. flag airc raft while in flight ov er waters seaward of state wa ters, and 
may also app ly with respect to thos e flying over waters seaward of the high 
water line al ong the coas t and seaw ard of harbor works or narrow 
promontories (thus bringing in the majority of the state waters al ong the 
Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, and Great Lakes coasts); an d 
•Offenses by or against U.S. nationals committed ou tside the jurisdiction of 
any nation. 
In view of the complexity in the SMTJ, IOs should contact their  servicing legal 
office to discuss the issues should SMTJ jurisdictio n come into question. ‘detection’ activity.  Direct entry of enfor cement a ctivities without record of the 
underlying investigation/detection activity is expressly prohibited. 
F.SELECTED LAWS APPLICABLE IN THE MARITIME REALM
IOs must document and take appropriate action on  all violations or suspected
violations of federal law in the mariti me realm.  This section a ddresses a number 
of laws applicable in the maritime env ironment of which all IOs should be aware.  
These laws are an important enforcement responsibility and in some cases will 
require significant or imm ediate attenti on.  Duty attorneys are av ailable at all 
district legal offices and should be contacted when necessary to assist. 
Certain federal statutes, in cluding a number of those addressed i n this sectio n, 
contain speci al terms delineating wher e and to who m they appl y.  One particularly 
important ex ample is that many federa l criminal laws that th e Coast Guard
enforces are only applica ble in what is  known as th e “Special Maritime and 
Territorial Ju risdiction” (S MTJ).  See 18 USC 7 and  33 CFR 2. 05-1(b). 
 F.3.OVERVIEW OF 
SELECTED CRIMINAL 
LAWSA felony is any criminal law whose m aximum potential penalty exceeds one year of 
imprisonment.  Misdemeanors are all less serious federal crimes .  Classification as 
a felony or misdemeanor depends upon the maxi mum penalty provisions of the 
statute, not the actual sen tence adjudg ed.  This section addresses the following 
categories of offenses the IO should str ongly pursue should evidence of same be 
encountered:
•Obstruction of Boardings; 
•Customs Laws; 
•Stolen Vessels; 
•Violent Acts; 
•Firearms La ws; 
•Intentional Damage to Vessels; 
•False Distress Calls; 
•False Official Statemen ts; 
•Interstate Flight; 
•Bribery of Public Officials; 
•Neutrality Act; and 
•Property Crimes other than Stolen Vessels. 
F.4.OBSTRUCTION 
OF BOARDINGThe following non-felony  statutes may apply to individuals who obstruct a Coast 
Guard boarding without engaging in an assault: 
•See 19 USC 70 (master o nly).  Obstructing or hindering an officer going 
aboard to en force U.S. revenue or navigation laws subjects the master to 
an administrative civil penalty. 
•See 19 USC 1581(d).  Failure to st op on command of an officer of 
customs subjects the offender to an a dministrative civil penalty. 
F.5.CUSTOMS 
LAWSF.5.a.  General The IO shall remember that criminal prosecution may only be referred to DOJ by 
District Com mander.  For this reason, and to ensur e legally prudent use of CG 
and CGIS skills/authority, IOs/SIOs s hould contact CGIS and D(l) when one of 
these crimes is detected. 
•See 46 USC 324.  Obstructing or hindering an officer enforcing the 
licensing or documenta tion laws subjects  the offender to an a dministrative 
civil penalty. 
See 19 USC 1703.  Building, purchasing, or  outfitt ing a vessel for the purposes of 
smugglin g into the United States or defr auding the revenue of the U.S. makes the 
vessel and its cargo subject to seizure a nd civil forfeiture.  There are no provisions 
under this statute for san ctions against individuals. 
 F.5.b.  Smuggling into Foreign Nations 
F.5.c.  Hidden Compartments 
F.6STOLEN 
VESSELSF.6.a.  Applicable Federal Statutes 
Instances in which the ph ysical taking of the vessel itself constitutes a federal
crime typical ly involve one or more of the following statutes (ea ch of which must 
be considered carefully to determine its applicability). 
•See 18 USC 661.  Takin g and carrying away property within the SMTJ.  A 
felony has been committed if the stolen property is worth more than $100.  
The theft is not a federal crime unle ss both the “taking” and th e “carrying 
away” elem ents occur within the SMTJ. 
•See 18 USC 1651.  Piracy under the la w of nations.  Piracy consists of any 
illegal acts of violence or detention or  any acts of d epredation committed 
seaward of the territorial sea of any na tion (i.e., seaward of the 12 NM 
territorial seas of the United States) fo r private ends by the crew or 
passengers of a private ship or aircraft  and directed against another ship or 
aircraft.  In contrast, muti ny or ot her internally generated takeo ver of a 
vessel by tho se already ab oard is not piracy.  By en gaging in piracy, a vessel 
essentially becomes statel ess.  This statute applies to and may be enforced 
against any p irate vessel purporting to  fly any flag.  The determi nation of 
whether a vessel is engaged in piracy requires a Commandant’s Statemen t 
of No Objection (SNO).  Piracy unde r this law is punishable by life 
imprisonment. 
•See 18 USC 2275.  Firing at or ta mper ing with a vessel within U.S. 
jurisdiction or endangering the persons onboard such vessels is a felony 
offense. 
F.6.b.  Related Crimes 
As noted, in the majority of cases involv ing possible stolen vess els, the physi cal 
taking of the vessel is not itself a fe deral crime.  Subsequent acts, however, 
involving the  vessel and/or perpetrator may provide a basis for federal 
enforcement action.  The federal criminal statutes s ummarized b elow (ea ch of
which must be considered carefully to determine when applicab le) are all 
potentially a vailable whether or not th e physical ta king was a federal crime. This statute may also app ly to vessels attemp ting to smuggle merchandise in to the 
territory of a foreign nation against foreig n law (if that nation has laws providing 
for penalty or forfeiture for violation of  U.S. laws respecting th e customs revenue).
The most co mmon circu mstance where vessels are found to be outfitted for 
smuggling involves the discovery of hidden compa rtments.  The presence o f
contraband i s not legally re quired for seizure and forfeiture to proceed.  However, 
most forfeitures under this statute h ave involved at least residue of contraba nd. 
•See 18 USC 2276.  Breaking or enterin g a vessel with the intent to commit 
a felony, if committed wi thin the adm iralty and ma ritime jurisdiction of the 
U.S. but outside the jurisdiction of any state is a felo ny offense. 
 •See 18 USC 662.  Knowing receipt of st olen property within th e SMTJ is a 
federal felony if the stolen pr operty is worth more than $100. 
•See 18 USC 1001.  Making false statem ents or providing false documents 
to federal officials in the performance of their duty is a felony. 
•See 18 USC 2197.  Unlawfully using or exhibiting, or attempting to use or 
exhibit any certificate, license, or docu ment issued to U.S. vessels, officers, 
or seamen b y an authorized officer  is a felony.  Altering, forging, 
counterfeiting, or stealing such a certificate is also a  felony. 
F.7.VIOLENT 
ACTSAny injury or fatality case with the followi ng characteristics should be scrutinized 
closely for potential unla wful activity: 
•When one or  more of the crewmembers onboard is known to have a 
questionable background or uncertain identity; 
•When the vessel leaves its last port of call or departure point unobserved; 
•When a vess el is outfitted in a way inconsistent with its use; 
•When the vessel is known to have a large sum of money, nego tiable 
instruments, or other valuables aboard; and/or 
F.8.VIOLENT 
ACTS WITHIN THE 
SMTJ F.8.a.  Murder within the SMTJ 
F.8.b. Manslaughter within the SMTJ 
See 18 USC 1112.  The st atute defines manslaughter as the unlawful killin g of a 
human being without mal ice:  voluntary (upon sudd en quarrel or heat of passion); 
or involuntary (in the commission of an unlawful act not amou nting to a felony or 
without due caution with respect to a l awful act wh ich might produce death ).  
Manslaughter, both voluntary and involuntary, is a felony. •See 18 USC 2314.  The National St olen Property Act prohibits the 
knowing transportation of stolen goods worth more than $5000 in 
interstate or foreign commerce (i.e, ac ross state lines including maritime 
boundaries, or between the U.S. territo rial sea and the high seas ).  Once 
the stolen goods have been transporte d in interstate or foreign commerce, 
the federal cr ime has been  committed and returning the property to where 
it was taken does not def eat federal jurisdiction.  This is a felony offense. 
•When there are inconsistencies in accounts or with relevant known facts. 
See 18 USC 1111.  The statute defines first and second degree murder.  First 
degree murder generally includes premeditated or  deliberate killing, and tho se 
committed i n the course of other crimes like arson, rape, or robbery.  Second 
degree murder includes those killings not  within the definition of first degree 
murder.  Attempted mur der is addressed in 18 US C 1113. 
 F.8.c.  Aggravated Sexual Abuse within the SMTJ. 
F.8.d.  Assault within the SMTJ. 
An assault is generically defined as a reasonable apprehension of a harmful or 
offensive touching.  Physical contact is  not required for an assault to have 
occurred (e.g., an individual points a firearm at ano ther or attem pts to stab a nother 
but misses).  As a practical matter, simple nonviolent acts legall y constitutin g
assault may not warrant r eferral for criminal prosecution.  The specific assault 
statutes b elow have additional elemen ts or limitations before enforcement action 
can be initiated. 
•See 18 USC 111.  This st atute prohibi ts forcible assault on federal officers 
(listed in 18 USC 1114) while they ar e engaged in, or on accou nt of, the 
performance of their official duties.  These offenses are felonies. 
•See 18 USC 113.  This st atute prohibi ts the unlawf ul application of, or 
attemp ted us e of, force within the SMTJ.  Unlike 18 USC 111, the victim 
of the assault need not be a federal officer, but could be anyone.   Lawful 
force requires that there b e a legal justification for the use of force and tha t
the amount of force used was reasona bly necessary.  Simple assault and 
assault by str iking, beating, or wo unding are misdemeanors.  All other 
assaults, such as with intent to co mmit any felony, with a dang erous 
weapon, or resulting in serious bodily injury or forc e, are felonies.  Other 
assault statutes exist.  For example, various fisheries acts contain specific 
assault provisions. 
F.9.FIREARMS 
LAWSThe serial number of any firearm discovered  during an inspectio n, investigation, or 
boarding sho uld be check ed through EPIC.  The unlawful possession of a 
federally regulated firearm is a felony offe nse.  All unregistered federally regulated 
firearms, regardless of serviceability, are c ontraband  and are subject to sei zure.  See 
the following statutes: 
•18 USC 922(g); 
•26 USC 5801 et seq., The Gun Contr ol Act; 
•28 USC 5861(d), Federally Regulated Firearms; an d See 18 USC 2241.  Any person knowingly causing another pers on to engage in a 
sexual act by using force, threatening or pl acing the other person in fear of death, 
serious bodily injury or kidnapping or a ttemp ts to do so is a violation of this 
felony statute, punishable by life imprisonment.  Acts which un der various sate law 
would be ch aracterized a s rape, forcible sodomy, sexual assault, or any related 
attemp ts would be prosecuted under this statute. 
•See 18 USC 2231.  This statute makes it  a felony for anyone to f orcibly 
assault, resist, oppose, prevent, impede, intimidate or interfere with any 
person autho rized to serve or execute search warra nts or to ma ke searches 
and seizures while engaged in those du ties.  The penalties are greater if a 
deadly wea pon is used in the commis sion of this act.

SAFETY 
RECOMMENDATIONS
A.3.SAFETY

ADMINISTRATIVE 
RECOMMENDATIONS
B.1.BASIS FOR 
SAFETY  
RECOMMENDATIONSB.1.a.  General 
Safety recommendations should be based upon an d flow logica lly from the 
findings of fact and co nclusions of the incident investigation.  To determine 
whether a sa fety recomm endation is a ppropriate, the Marine Board or 
Investigating Officer (IO) should ask the following questions: 
Has the existence of a specific condition been identi fied?  
Has that co ndition been determined to be latently unsafe?  A.SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS IN GENERAL
The purpose of Safety Recommendations is to propose correcti ve actions for 
identified latent unsafe conditions or other unwan ted outcom es deemed 
necessary to prevent thos e conditions fr om contributing to future casualties.
Safety recom mendations originate from se veral sources.  The principle source for 
safety recom mendations i s incident investigations completed b y Coast Gua rd 
Marine Boards and Investigating Officer s (IOs).  Investigators from other 
agencies or organizations, in particular  the Nation al Transportation Safety Bo ard 
(NTSB), also issue safety recommendations.  Other sources include task forces, 
quality actio n teams, and  other tempo rary groups assigned to study, review and 
analyze a par ticular aspect of maritime  operations.  Members of the public may 
submit safety recommendations as well.  For the purposes of this chapter, we will 
focus on those safety recommendatio ns issued by Coast Guard  Marine Boards 
and IOs upon completion of marine incident inves tigations. 
In some instances, a latent unsafe condit ion that is identified and, if left 
unaddressed, poses an im mediate threat to safety in a fleet of vessels or particular 
type of oper ation. When this occurs, the Coa st Gu ard wants to quickly advise the 
public of the condition, explain why it is a threat, and propose actions to mitigate 
that threat.  In these circu mstances, th e issuance of a safety alert instead of a 
safety recom mendation may be a mo re appropriate mechanism  to accompli sh 
this.  Guidance on the us e of safety alerts can be found in sectio ns F through I of 
this chapter.
During the course of the incident inve stigation process, recom mendations are 
made regarding the status  of the investigation and whether enf orcement a ction 
may appropr iate.  Exampl es include a recommend ation that the i nvestigation be 
closed or that further investigation into possible violations, misconduct, 
negligence, etc. is warranted.  These ar e not consid ered safety r ecommend ations.  
They are par t of the inter nal administrative proced ures of the Coast Guard, and 
as such, SHALL NOT to be included with safety recommend ations.

•Can control be exercise d over that condition?
Has it been determined that controls do  not currently exist tha t adequately 
address that condition? 
B.1.b.  Existence of Latent Unsafe Conditions 
Safety recom mendations must address  actual  latent unsafe conditions that ha ve 
been found to exist rather than hypoth etical conditi ons.  Safety recommend ations 
may be made to address any latent uns afe condition identified during an incident 
investigation, including th ose that did not cause no r contribute to the specific 
incident und er investigation.  When doin g so, the Marine Board or Investigating 
Officer (IO) will need to include an ex planation of the risks and probable 
consequences associated with the continue d existence of the condition, as it will 
not necessari ly be evident from the facts and concl usions of the incident at h and.  
See Chapter B4 of this volume for information on latent unsafe conditions. 
B.1.c.  Control over Latent Unsafe Condition 
B.1.d.  Lack of Adequate Control Measures 
Safety recom mendations should only be made  to address latent unsafe conditions 
when one of  the following is true: 
There are no  current control measures in place. 
The current control meas ures are found to be inadequate.
B.2.CONTENT OF 
SAFETY 
RECOMMENDATIONSB.2.a.  General Content and Format
Once it has been determined that a s afety recomm endation is a ppropriate, the 
Marine Board or Investigating Officer (IO) will want to draft it in a clear, simple 
and easily un derstood ma nner.  In general, there are three basic questions th at a 
Marine Board or IO wants to answer when makin g a safety recommendatio n: 
Who should implement the recommended corrective action? 
What is the r ecommend ed corrective action? 
What will be the result of im plementing that correctiv e action ?Safety recom mendations should only be made to a ddress those latent unsafe 
conditions over which some level of control can be exercised through the 
implementation and use of control measures.  Control measures include 
conventions, laws, regulations, policies and procedu res. 
Safety recom mendations should not be ma de wh en the unsafe condition was  the 
result of non-compliance with an existi ng control measure (e.g. a mariner 
intentionally ignored the prohibition agains t smoking during a t ransfer operation).•

B6-3 B.2.b.  Who Should Implement the Recommended Action 
Each safety r ecommend ation needs to be  addressed  to someone who has the 
authority an d responsibility over the control measu res that woul d be affected  by 
the recomm ended corrective action.  Factors  to con sider when determining this 
include, but are not limited to the following: 
•The nature o f the latent u nsafe condition; 
•The extent to which the condition exists (e.g. local, national, 
international ); 
•The nature o f the recom mended action (e.g. procedural, policy-related, 
regulatory, legislative,); and 
•The authority needed to implement th e recommen ded action. 
B.2.c.  Recommended Action 
The Marine Board or Investigating Officer (IO) needs to be un ambiguous when 
describing the recommen ded corrective  action.  The text of the safety 
recommenda tion should identify the cont rol measu re that is the subject of th e 
safety recom mendation (e.g. procedures, policy, regulations, laws, conventions, 
etc.) and explain what specific and direct action sho uld be taken to address th e 
latent unsafe condition.  In general, such actions co uld include: 
•Amending existing law, regulations, policy or procedures; or 
•Development and implementation of  new laws, regulations, policies or 
procedures; 
B.2.d.  Result of Action 
B.3.ADDITION OF 
SAFETY 
RECOMMENDATIONSSafety recom mendations that are addressed to speci fic Coast Guard units should 
be addressed  to the heads  of those units (e.g. Commandant, Di strict Comm ander, 
Commandin g Officer).  Safety recom mendati ons addressed to parties outside of 
the Coast Guard should be addressed to the organization, not an individual 
within the or ganization. 
Marine Boards and IOs should avoid using phrases such as “should consider” or 
“should review” as these indicate uncertai nty and a lack of a compelling need for 
corrective action. 
The Marine Board or Investigating Officer (IO) should explain how they believe 
the recommended corrective action will mitigate or eliminate the latent unsaf e
condition or unwanted ou tcome. 
During the review of safety recomm endations withi n the relevan t Coast Guar d 
chain of command, whoever is conducting  the review may iden tify the need for 
safety recommendations not proposed by the Mar ine Board or Investigating 
Officer (IO).  These reco mmendation s should be included in th e activity/cas e

C.3.FINAL 
ACTIONC.3.a.  Definition 
The Final Action is the official Coast Guard response to a safety recommendation 
and indicates  whether th e Coast Guard  conc urs or does not con cur with a sa fety 
recommenda tion.  In general, there are three possi ble determin ations for the final 
action: 
“Concur – Acceptable Action” – Indica tes that the Coast Guard  agrees 
that th e laten t unsafe con dition identified in the safety recom mendation 
needs to be addressed and will take  the recommend ed corrective action. 
“Concur- Alternate Accep table Action ” – Indicates that th e Coast Guard 
agrees that the latent uns afe condition identified in the safety 
recommenda tion needs to  be addressed, but does not agree with  the 
recommended corrective action.  Instead, an alternate action will be taken 
to address th e condition. 
“Do Not Concur – No Action Necessary” – Indicates that the Coast 
Guard does not agree with the determination that a dditional acti on needs 
to be taken to address a latent unsafe condition. file.
C.REVIEWING SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS
Each safety r ecommend ation that is issued by a Marine Board or Investigating 
Officer (IO) is subjected to a process o f review and endorsement through the 
relevant Coast Guard chain of command in order to evaluate its  merits for 
acceptance a nd implemen tation.  The end goal of this process is the determination 
of the final action for the safety recom mendation. 
If there are units within the chain of command between th e issuing Investigating 
Officer (IO) and the unit responsible for determining final action, those units shall 
review and endorse each safety recom mendation b efore forwarding them to  the 
next unit in the chain of command.  The endorsem ent should indicate wh ether the 
reviewing unit concurs or does not co ncur with th e safety reco mmendation  and 
provide an explanation for its determ ination. 
Where it has been determined that the Coa st Guard  does not co ncur with a s afety 
recommendation, the unit responsible for determining the final action should 
include an explanation for its determin ation.  Where it has been determined that 
the Coast Guard concurs with a safety recommend ation, the uni t responsible for 
determining the final acti on should include a descr iption of the actions it will take 
to implemen t the safety recommend ation and an es timate for when those a ctions 
will be completed.  If the actions neces sary to implement the s afety 
recommenda tion have already been co mpleted, this  should also be indicated in the 
final action.•

B6-5 C.3.b.  Who Determines Final Action 
In general, the authority to determine the final acti on will reside with the head of 
the responsible Coast Guard unit.  The following guidelines are provided to help 
establish who will determine the final action:   
For a safety recommend ation issued from a unit initiated investi gation 
(formal or informal), the head of the Coast Guard  unit that hol ds the 
authority an d responsibility for the co ntrol measure(s) affected by the 
safety recommendation will determine the final acti on.   
For a safety recommend ation issued from  a district formal investigation, 
the District Commander or Commandant will determine the final action as 
appropriate.   
For a safety recommend ation issued from a Commandant’s Marine Board 
of Investigation, the Com mandant will  determine the final action. 
For a safety recommend ation issued from any inves tigation addressed to 
someone outside of the Coast Guard, the Commandant will determine the 
final action.

(CG-545).
D.RELEASING SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINAL ACTION
The releasing authority and ultimate r esponsibility for the final action on a s afety 
recommenda tion resides with the hea d of the Coast Guard unit that determined 
the final acti on. 
The final action on individual safety reco mmenda tions may be r eleased to th e 
public upon their completion, regardless of  the status of the investigation case 
from which the safety recommendatio ns were issued. 
Final action on a safety r ecommend ation may be shared broadly within the Coast 
Guard and throughout the maritime community a nd general public.  Accordingly, 
the releasing authority ma y distribute the final action by any app ropriate mea ns, 
subject to th e restrictions of the Privacy Act. 
E.IMPLEMENTING FINAL ACTION
Where the d etermination  has been ma de that the C oast Guard d oes not concur 
with a safety recommenda tion, the Coa st Guard’s actions are co mplete wh en that

IMPLEMENTATIONIn many cases where the determinatio n has been made tha t the Coast Gua rd 
concurs with  a safety reco mmendation , the Coast Guard’s actions to implement 
the safety recommendation will not be immediate, but extend ov er a period of 
time.  In such instances, the authority responsible for the final action will also be 
responsible for tracking and documenting the statu s and eventu al completion of 
the Coast G uard’s implementing acti ons.  Specific information to be docu mented 
includes: 
•Estimated s tart date/co mpletion date;
•Estimated effort to comp lete (resources); 
•Actual start date; 
•Status of acti ons, including periodic documenta tion of actions co mpleted 
up to a parti cular point in time, problems or delays encountered, and 
changes to o riginal plans for implementation; and 
•Actual co mpletion date.

SAFETY ALERTS
F.3.SAFETY 
RECOMMENDATIONSSafety recommendations are intended to pr opose corrective acti ons for identified 
latent unsafe conditions deemed neces sary to prevent those con ditions from 
contributing to future incidents.  Thes e corrective actions may i nclude chang es to 
policy, law, or regulation.  Althou gh similar, safety alerts and safety 
recommenda tions differ in the following ways: 
•Safety alerts are only based upon conditi ons identified in the findings of already been taken or are completed i mmedi ately.  In such instances, those actions 
should be documented in the final acti on with an i ndication of when they were 
completed. 
In some instances, events  occur which  indicate tha t a previous determination  of 
final action for a safety recommenda tion may be in correct or incomplete.  In such 
cases, the res ponsible Coast Guard aut hority has the discretion to review and 
amend the fi nal agency action.  If the final action is amended, th e new final a ction 
should include an explan ation of why the original was amend ed. 
F.SAFETY ALERTS IN GENERAL
The purpose of safety alerts is to quickly advise the public of conditions tha t, if 
left unaddressed, pose urgent threa ts to safety in fleets of vessels or particular 
types of oper ations and propose voluntary actions for elimination or mitigation of 
those threa ts. 
Safety alerts originate primarily from mari ne casua lty investigations completed by 
Coast Guard  Marine Boards and Investigating Officers (IOs).  However, th e 
issuance of a safety alert will be considered  based upon its merits regardless of its 
source.

B6-7 fact.  Safety recommend ations are based upon and flow logically from the 
findings o f fact and concl usions drawn through causal analysis. 
•Safety alerts are issued to the public  in general or may be focused on a 
general segment of the m aritime com munity.  Safety recomm endations 
are issued to a specific person, unit or organization.  
•Safety alerts recommend voluntary ac tions.  Safety recommenda tions may 
result in the implementa tion of mandatory requirements and pr ocedures. 
•Safety alerts primarily involve imme diate actions intended as sh ort-term 
solutions.  Safety recomm endations m ay involve actions being taken over 
an extended period of time to  provide a long-term solution. 
F.4.LESSONS 
LEARNED
G.1.BASIS FOR 
SAFETY ALERTG.1.a.  General 
Safety alerts should be based upon the findings of fact from the incident 
investigation.   To determ ine whether a safety alert is appropriate, the Marine 
Board or Investigating Officer (IO) should ask the following questions: 
•Has the existence of a specific latent u nsafe condition been iden tified? 
•What is the extent of the condition?  Is it common  in the overall maritime 
community, within a parti cular class or fleet, or is it rarely found on 
vessels, facilities or in operations? 
G.1.b.  Existence of a Latent Unsafe Condition 
G.1.c.  Extent of the Latent Unsafe Condition Guidance on  the use of sa fety recomm endations ca n be found in Sections A 
through E of this Chapter . 
Lessons learned are another means of advising the public of unsafe conditions, as 
well as reco mmending actions that can be taken to mitigate or eliminate th em.  
However, unlike safety alerts, lessons learned are no t urgent and are typically 
published upon completi on of an incident investigation as a means of 
emphasizing the need to prevent unsa fe conditions from arising.  Except for the 
urgency of the process, the drafting, approv al and release of lessons learned is the 
same as for safety alerts. 
G.DRAFTING SAFETY ALERTS
•Is there an u rgent need to recommen d taking actions to mitigate the 
impact of th e identified latent unsafe condition? 
Safety alerts must address  actual latent unsafe conditions that ha ve been found to 
exist rather than hypothetical conditio ns.  Safety alerts may be made to add ress 
any laten t unsafe condition identified during an incident investigation. 
When deter mining whether a safety a lert is  appropriate, the Marine Board or the

G.2.CONTENT OF 
SAFETY ALERTSG.2.a.  General Content and Format 
A safety alert should convey the following information: 
•A clear and precise descr iption of the latent unsafe condition; 
•A short explanation of why the condition is unsafe (i.e. what are the 
consequences if no action is taken); and 
•Recommend ed action(s ) to be taken to  eliminate or mitigate the 
condition. 
G.2.b.  What Is Not Included 
Safety alerts are intended to address o nly la tent un safe conditions identified in the 
findings of fact and reco mmended a ctions to miti gate or eliminate th e con ditions.  
They are not to include a ny reference to conclusio ns drawn from causal or 
violation analysis regardin g the following: 
•Whether an i dentified condition was th e cause or a contributing factor to 
the incident under investigation, and if so, the extent of its role in the 
incident; or  
•Whether an i dentified condition, or any actions lea ding to that condition, 
are or may b e considered a vi olation of law or regulation. 
G.2.c.  Language and Terminology Investigating Officer (IO) should attemp t to ascertain the exten t to which th e 
identified condition exists outside of the specific incident tha t is being 
investigated.  If it is determined to be  a common condition that extends over a 
broad range of vessels, fa cilities, parties or operations, whether of a certain type 
or within some geographical boundary, then a safety alert ma y be appropriate. 
Safety alerts should generally be limited  to addressing those latent unsafe 
conditions that, if no immediate action is taken, will result in additional incidents 
in the near future.  In most other situ ations, where the conditi on is either rare or 
is less likely to contribute to an inciden t, then a safety recomm endation may b e
more appropriate. 
•If appropriate, a disclaimer indicati ng that the Co ast Guard has not yet 
concluded whether this or any other condition played a part in the cause 
or severity of the incident under investigation. 
While the Investigating Officer (IO) m ust ensure that th e language used when 
drafting a safety alert is su fficiently precise, he/she must also tak e into 
consideratio n the audien ce for which the alert is in tended, as th e various sectors 
of the maritime commun ity have different levels of technical ex pertise and, in 
many cas es, their own ter minology.  Safety alerts i ntended for a specific sector

H.3.APPROVAL OF 
SAFETY ALERTSH.3.a.  Definition 
H.3.b.  Who Determines Approval 
In general, the authority to approve a saf ety alert will reside with the head of the 
responsible Coast Guard  unit.  The following guidelines are provided to help 
establish who will determine the approval of a safety alert: 
•For a safety alert drafted from a unit initiated inves tigation (formal or 
informal), the head of the Coast Guar d unit that h olds the auth ority and 
responsibility for the area/community  affected by a safety alert will 
determine its  approval. 
•For a safety alert drafted from a distri ct formal investigation, the District 
Commander or Commandant will determine its approval. need to use l anguage and terminology that is appro priate for that particular 
sector.  For example, a sa fety alert intended for the recreational boating 
community would be ph rased differently than  one of a similar nature intended for 
the comm ercial fishing industry. 
Safety alerts should be as short as possible to allow for rapid and widest 
dissemination, while still adequatel y explaining the situation. 
H.REVIEWING SAFETY ALERTS
Each safety a lert that is drafted by a M arine Board or Investigating Officer (IO) is 
subject to a process of review and en dorsement through the relevant Coas t
Guard chain of command  in order to eval uate its m erits.  The end goal of this 
process is the determinati on of its approval for release. 
If there are units within the chain of  command between th e dra fting Marine 
Board or Investigating Officer (IO) and th e unit res ponsible for the approval and 
release of a safety alert, th ose units shall review and endorse the safety alert 
before forwarding it to the next unit in  the chain of  command.  The endorsement 
should indicate whether the reviewing unit concurs or does not concur with the 
safety alert a nd provide an explanatio n for its determination.  By their natu re, 
safety alerts are very time sensitive.  Accordingly, reviewers should give safety 
alerts a high priority for review through the chain o f command for approval and 
release. 
The approval of a drafted safety alert i s similar to the final action for a safety 
recommendation.  It represents the offici al Coast Guard response to a draft safety 
alert and indicates wh ether the Coast Guard concu rs or does not concur tha t the 
issuance of a safety alert i s necessary and/or appropriate.

I.1.AUTHORITY TO 
RELEASE SAFETY 
ALERTS
I.2.TIMING OF 
RELEASE
I.3.MEANS OF 
RELEASESafety alerts may be relea sed through one or more appropriate means at the 
discretion of the releasing authority.  In general, the means of release should  be 
such that it i s focused on the target au dience of the safety alert.  Some typical
means of release include:
•Press Release - perhaps the most effective in "getting the word out" it is 
also one of the least ca pable at targeti ng a specific sector of the maritime 
community. 
•E-mail Distribution List - some units have developed, or are developing, 
e-mail distribution lists of members of the various sectors of the maritime 
community that operate within their AOR (e.g. all local T-boat operators).  
This method  of distribution allows fo r improved targeting of a particular 
group; however, its usefu lness is dependent on the e-mail capabilities of 
the intended audience. 
•Internet Publication - many Coast Gu ard units now have web sites that, in 
addition to providing unit specifi c information (e.g. address, phone 
numbers, missions, etc.), are also used to post ann ouncements and other 
information intended for public release.  If units intend to publi sh safety 
alerts on thei r web site, th ey should ad vertise the web address a nd 
encourage th e public to check it regularly.  This method allows  for a wide 
distribution with little effort, but is one of the least capable a t targeting a 
specific sector of the maritime comm unity. Approval of all Comman dant-level safety al erts wil l be coordinated via the O ffice 
of Investigations and Analysis, Commandant (CG- 545). 
I.RELEASING SAFETY ALERTS
The releasing authority for a safety al ert re sides with the head o f the Coast Guard 
unit that app roved it. 
The release of a safety al ert should occur as soon after its approval as possible.  
As with all matters dealing with making  information regarding an incident 
available to the public, the releasing authority mus t be sensitive to the impa ct a 
safety alert may have on grievin g families and on the professional image of the 
Coast Guard .
•Periodicals - periodicals such as maga zines and newsletters, wh ether 
published by the Coast Guard or a commercial organization, can be a very 
effective means of targeting a specifi c audience.  In many cas es though, 
the delay in writing, proofing and pu blishing the periodical make this

periodicals may be used as an effective means of following up on the 
initial release and emphas izing the information provided in the safety 
alert.

 A.1.WHAT IS A 
MARINE CASUALTY ? 
See 46 CFR 
4.03-1A marine cas ualty or acci dent is any i ncident involving any vessel (except a p ublic 
vessel) that o ccurs on the navigable waters of the United States a nd involving any 
vessel U.S. vessel (except a public vessel), that results in: 
•Damage to o r by the vess el or gear; or 
•Injury or los s of life to any person. 
Some typical  marine casu alties are: 
•Collisions 
•Allisions 
•Groundings 
•Heavy wea ther damage 
•Fires 
•Explosions 
•Failure of gear and equipment 
•Any damage affecting or impairing seaworthiness of a vessel 
•Any injury 
•Any loss of life, and 
A.2.WHICH 
REPORTABLE MARINE 
CASUALTIES DO WE 
INVESTIGATE ? 
See 46 CFR 4.05-1 
and 
46 CFR 4.01-3A.2.a.  General 
All incidents  reported to the Coast G uard, regardless of the source, will be 
investigated in accordance with 46 US C 6301 and 46 CFR 4.07,  however, the 
OCMI/COTP must determine on a case-by-case  basis what in vestigative actions are 
appropriate for a specific case based o n the likely value to marin e safety, avail able 
resources, and risks in a given port.  The criteria for the investigation of marine 
casualties an d determining level of effort are detail ed below. 
A.2.b.  Criteria for the Investigation of Marine 
Casualties and Determining the Level of Investigative 
Effort 
Preliminary Investigations A preliminary investigation shall be conducted for any 
report or evidence of a reportable mar ine casualty as defined in 46 CFR 4.05-1 
involving a U.S. or foreign flag com mercial  vessel.  The follo wing criteria applies: 
•When a preliminary investigation reveals that a rep ortable marine casualty a s
defined in 46 CFR 4.05-1 has in fact occu rred, the level of investigative effort 
shall be raised to a data collection acti vity, informal investigation, or formal 
investigation.  
•When a preliminary investigation reveals that a m arine casualty meets th e MISLE A.MARINE CASUALTIES AND INCIDENTS
•Any injury or loss of life while di ving from a vessel using underwater 
breathing apparatus. 
 Data Entry Exemption below, is not repor table under 46 CFR 4.0 5-1, or it cannot 
be verified that a marine casualty has occu rred, no additional investigative effort is 
required and the results o f the preliminary investigation shall be documented  in 
MISLE in accordance with the MISLE Process Guides. 
•Investigations closed at th e preliminary level should be documented in the 
MISLE notification only; however if an Incident Investigation Activity is 
generated in MISLE there is no requirement for findings of fact (timeline) en tries. 
Data Collection Activities A data co llection activ ity shall be conducted for all 
reportable marine casualti es as defined in 46 CFR 4.05-1 not assigned to Informal 
Investigation or Formal Investigation .  MISLE data entr y requiremen ts shall be in 
accordance with the Inv estigations a nd Enforcement Proces s Guide. 
•MISLE Inci dent Investigation Data Entry .Normally, the reported casua lty 
information should be entered into MISLE with only minimum effort expended 
to verify its accuracy and completen ess in accordan ce with th e Investigations and 
Enforcemen t Process Guide. The intent of this policy is to reduce the unit 
workload resulting from investigation of  minor marine casualties to an absol ute 
minimum while retaining basic event i nformation for trend and statistical an alysis. 
•MISLE Inci dent Investigation Data Entry Exceptions .No MISLE data 
entry beyond  the MISLE notification information (see Chapter B2) is necess ary 
or desired for marine casualties meeti ng th e below criteria.  For incidents m eeting 
this criteria, the CG-2692 and any oth er material received should be documen ted 
in the notification after m inimal review to verify that the incid ent meets on e of 
the criteria. The unit shall electroni cally attach the CG-2692 an d other 
‘notification’ material to the MISLE notification. 
1.Groundings involving "bump and go" touching of the bottom on 
Western Rivers (as defined in 33 USC 2003) by uninspected to wing 
vessels and uninspected b arges in the navigation channel with no damage, 
no pollution, no personnel injuries, no br eaking apart of the tow,  and no 
assistance required to resume voyage.  
2.Casualties involving only minor injury. A minor injury is any injury that 
does not res ult in broken bones (other than fingers, toes, or nose), loss of 
limbs, severe hemorrhaging, severe muscle, nerve, tendon, or internal 
organ damage, or in hospitalization for more than 4 8 hours within 5 days 
of the injury.  
3.Casualties involving in juries when the injuries result from a pre-existing 
medical condition and not from a marine operation.  (i.e.  a mariner with 
diabetes suffers a spell of blurry vision, and during the spell trips because 
he did not see a deck fitti ng and breaks  a leg.)  If the mariner holds license 
 or merchant mariner’s document the i ncident shou ld be investigated to 
determine if suspension and revocatio n proceedings should be pursued by 
reason of medical incomp etence. 
4.Casualties (other than collisions and allisions) reported only because of 
property da mage in excess of $25,000 where the p roperty dam age does 
not exceed $ 100,000.  
5.Casualties involving U.S. state-number ed commerci al vessels exempt from 
reporting to the Coast G uard under 46 CFR 4.01-3(a), unless the incident 
meets th e criteria to cond uct a formal or informal investigation. 
Informal Investigations An informal investigation should be conducted f or any 
casualty invo lving a U.S. or foreign flag  commercia l vessel and meeting any of the 
below criteria.  MISLE data entry req uirements sh all be in acco rdance with the 
MISLE Process Guides. 
•Death : One death. Dea th cases may b e downgraded to the Data Collection Activity
level of investigation after credible evid ence (such as a death certificate) indicates 
death from natural causes (including a pre- existing medical con dition) or suicide.  
•Injury : One injury which results in fra ctured bones  (other than fingers, toes, or 
nose), loss of limbs, severe hemorrhaging,  severe muscle, nerve, tendon, or 
internal organ damage, or in hospitalization for more than 48 hours within 5 days 
of the injury.  
•Vessel loss : Loss of an uninspected v essel of less than 500 GT, or loss of a barge 
of more than 100 GT on inland waters  (as defined in 33 USC 2003).  
•Property damage : An ev ent involving a vessel and resulting in property dam age 
exceeding $100,000 but less than $1,00 0,000. The damage value comprises th e 
cost of labor and material to restore th e property (v essels, shoreline facilities, 
pipelines, OCS facilities, etc.) to its or iginal condition before the occurrence, but 
does not incl ude damage to natural res ources , or the cost of salvage, cleaning, gas-
freeing, dry -docking, or demurrage. Damage  values should be the best esti mates 
available immediately fol lowing the accident.  
•Collision : Any collision or allision resulting in property damage exceeding 
$25,000.  
•Loss of propulsion or steering : Any loss of propulsion or steering, even if 
momentary, affecting an inspected U.S. vessel anywhere, or affecting a foreign 
flag vessel or an uninspected U.S. vesse l over 100 GT on U.S. navigable waters. 
 •Flooding or fire : Flooding or fire that adversely affect a vessel’s  fitness for service 
on an inspected U.S. vessel anywhere, or on a foreign flag vessel or an 
uninspected U.S. vessel over 100 GT on U.S. navigable waters.  
•Equipment failure : Failure of Coast Guard-approved primary lifesaving 
equipment o r Coast Guard-approved firefighting equipment.  
•Discharge : Medium discharge of oil or medi um release of a hazardous substance 
(as defined in 40 CFR 300.5), or of hazardous cargoes regulated under  
46 CFR Subchapter O, i n which a vessel is the source or the cause of the 
discharge or release. 
•Commercial Diving Casualty . Death or injury of pe rsons diving from a vessel for 
commercial purposes.  
•Recreational Diving Casualty : Death or injury of pe rsons diving from a vessel in 
federal water s for recreational purposes.
Formal Investigation A formal investigation should be cond ucted for any casualty 
involving a U.S. or foreign flag commer cial vessel and meetin g any of the below 
criteria.  MISLE data entr y requiremen ts shall be in accordance with the MISLE 
Process Guides. 
•Death : 2 or more deaths.
•Injury : 2 or more seriously disabling injuries or 6 or more injuries which result in 
fractured bones (other than fingers, toes, or nose), loss of limbs, severe 
hemorrhaging, severe muscle, nerve, ten don, or internal organ damage, or in 
hospitalizati on for more than 48 hours within 5 days of the injury.  
•Vessel loss : Loss of an in spected vess el, or loss of an uninspected vessel of 500 
GT or more.  
•Property damage : An ev ent involving a vessel and resulting in property dam age 
exceeding $1,000,000. The damage val ue comprises  the cost of l abor and ma terial 
to restore the property (v essels, shoreline facilities, pipelines, OCS facilities, etc.) 
to its original condition before the occu rrence, but does not incl ude damage to 
natural resources, or the cost of salvage,  cleaning, gas-freeing, dry-docking, or 
demurrage. Damage values should be the best esti mates availa ble immediately 
following the acciden t.  
•Discharge : Major discharge of oil or major re lease of a hazardous substance (as 
defined in 40 CFR 300.5), or of hazardous cargoes regulated under  
46 CFR Subchapter O, i n which a vessel is the source or the cause of the 
 discharge or release. 
Foreign Flag Exception:  A formal investigation is  not required for a casualty 
involving on ly a foreign flag vessel (i.e., no U.S. vessel involved, no damage to U.S. 
property, and no injury of U.S. citizens). 
A.3.HAZARDOUS 
CONDITIONS
See 33 CFR 
160.215 The owner, agent, master, operator, or person in charge must report a hazar dous 
condition to the COTP if such a cond ition exists under 33 CFR  160.215.  A 
hazardous condition is any condition on the navigable waters of the United States 
that ma y adv ersely affect: 
•the safety of any vessel, bridge, structure, or shore area; or 
•the environmental quality of any port, ha rbor or navigable waterway of the 
United States. 
Typical haza rdous conditions include (but aren’t li mited to): 
•Collisions; 
•Allisions; 
•Fires; 
•Explosions; 
•Groundings; 
•Leaking; 
•Damage; 
•Injury or illn ess of a person onboard; and 
•Manning shortages. 
A.4.POST 
CASUALTY DRUG AND 
ALCOHOL TESTING 
See 46 CFR 4.05-
12 Following every marine casualty repor table to the Coast Guard under 46 CFR 4.05-
10, the marine employer must determine wh ether there is any evidence of alcohol or 
drug use by the individuals directly involved.  Such evidence ma y include chemical 
tests for drugs and alcohol.  Any evidence must be preserved and reported to the 
Coast Guard.  Again, this general responsibility applies to all reportable mar ine 
casualties, not only to seri ous marine incidents. 
A.5.WHO SHOULD 
BE TESTED AND 
WHEN TESTING 
SHOULD BE 
INITIATED
See 46 CFR 4.06-1Barge Exception:  A formal investigation is not required for the loss of a barge on 
inland waters  (as defined in 33 USC 2003). 
Reporting a hazardous condition to the CO TP does not allevia te the p erson of the 
responsibility to report a marine  casualty, or vice-versa. 
At the time of a marine casualty, the ma rine empl oyer must make a good faith 
determination whether the incident is or w ill likely become a s erious marine incident.  
If it is or likely will be, the marine empl oyer must decide whom aboard the vessel was 
directly involved in the incident.  A law enforcement officer can also decide who was 
directly involved, and “add” people to the marine employer’s list.  Those directly 
involved people, excluding passengers for hire, must be tested for drugs and a lcohol.  
 A.6.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
CONDUCTING THE 
TESTS AND RESULTS
See 46 CFR 4.06-5 
46 CFR 4.06-10, 
46 CFR 4.06-60, 
and 
46 CFR 4.05-10The marine employer is responsible for assuring t hat drug and alcohol testi ng is 
conducted, b ut no individual can legally be forced to give a sample for chemical 
testing.  In such refusal cases, the individual’s refusal must be d ocumented, and that 
person may be liable for a civil penalty or be subject to Coas t Guard action  against 
their MMC (if they hold one).  Evidence of drug or alcohol use, including test results, 
must be reported and made available to the Coast Guard as soon as possible after 
receipt. 
A.7.KINDS OF 
TESTS TO BE 
CONDUCTED
See 46 CFR 4.06-
20 
46 CFR 4.06-30, 
46 CFR 4.06-40,  
46 CFR 4.06-50, 
46 CFR part 16 . Chemical tes ts of an individual’s breath fo r the presence of alco hol may be conducted 
by an individual trained to  do so, and should be supervised by qualified collection 
personnel, the marine employer, his or her representative, or a law enforcement 
officer.  No specific chemical test for alcohol is required. 
In most insta nces, the ma rine employer themselves do not collect or analyze s amples 
for the presence of drugs.  In these cas es, the sampl e, collection, custody, anal ysis, 
and review must be com pleted according to the regulations contained in 46 CFR Part 
16. 
A.8.DESIGNATION 
AS A PARTY-IN-
INTEREST
See 46 CFR 4.03-
10 Any person who has a di rect interest i n the outco me of a marine casualty 
investigation can be involved in that invest igation.  Although IOs consider requests to 
be designated a Party-in -Interest  on a case-by-ca se basis.  Parties-in-interest are 
statutorily defined in 46 USC 6303. 
Parties-in-interest can be represented by attorneys or other persons, produce evidence 
for the Coast Guard to co nsider, call witnesses to give testimony for the Coast Guard, 
and have the right to examine eviden ce and tes timony given to the Coast G uard.  
Parties-in-interest exercis e their rights by requestin g them through the IO, who 
(because they retain control of the invest igation) will determine  whether the evidence 
and witnesses are necessa ry and relevant to the inv estigation’s purposes.   
In a formal investigation, parties-in-in terest genera lly are designated in writin g and 
exercise their rights through the IO during formal public hearings.  In an info rmal 
investigation, parties-in-interest are g enerally  not designated in writing, but are noted 
in the ROI, a nd arrangements regarding the need or  interest to b e present dur ing 
interviews an d the review of evidence is wo rked out on a case-by-case basis.  See 
Chapter A5 for more information. People ordered to be tested should not le ave their duties in the aftermath of an 
incident when their performance is necessary  to sa ve lives or property, or to protect 
the environment.  Wher ever possible, th e marine employer must assure alcohol 
testing is completed with in 2 hours of a serious marine incident.  Drug testing should 
be completed as soon as practicable after a serious marine incident.

effort. 
B.2.b.  Preliminary Level of Investigation 
B.2.c.  Data Collection Level of Investigation 
Marine casualty investigations that reach the data co llection level of investigation 
require the generating of a timeline wi th only enou gh information to meet the 
minimum data entry requ irements for M ISLE as detailed in the MISLE Process 
Guides. 
B.2.d.  Informal Level of Investigation 
Marine casualty investigations that reach th e informal level of in vestigation require 
the following: 
•Generating a Timeline:  All steps neces sary to comp lete the requi rements of 
causal analysis below. 
•Causal Analysis:  Shall determine the i nitiating event and all subsequent events. 
Shall analyze all applicable defense fa ilures or missing defenses between the 
events.  Should determine active failures in production and preconditions 
leading to them and the missing or failed defenses between them.   
•Human Error Analysis:  Shall determin e all unsafe acts and decis ions in 
production and all failed defenses.   
•Conclusions:   Shall be generated for any causal an d human error analysis 
factors that l ead to Safety Recommen dations. B.MARINE CASUALTY TERMINOLOGY AND ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
The following details policy with regar d to terminol ogy used in marine casua lty 
investigations for all levels of investiga tive effort. T he IMO Code was adopted and 
modified by the Coast G uard to describe the facts and causes o f the incidents we 
investigate, and is integrated as the co nceptual underpinning of MISLE.  Additionally, 
it eliminates the confusion that can arise wh en investigators arbitrarily choose one of 
the many ca uses at various levels as the “r oot cause.” The IMO approach yields that 
there is no single “root cause,”  instead there are many causal factors  that all 
contribute in  some way to  the incident. All other “root cause” language shall be 
avoided in order to minimize confusion . 
Marine casualty investigations that only re ach the pr eliminary level of investigation 
require no analysis be co mpleted beyond adequate fact-finding to determine that no 
further Coast Guard effort is required .

D.1.BASIC FIRE 
SCIENCED.1.a.  Elements of Combustion 
According to current reference texts, four ba sic elements must be present fo r a fire to 
occur: 
•Combustible fuels; 
•An oxidizer (such as oxygen in air); 
•Energy as a means of ignition (primarily in the form of heat); a nd 
•A self-sustaining reaction between fuel and oxygen. D.VESSEL FIRES AND EXPLOSIONS
Removing any one of these four elements will extinguish a fire; all four elements must 
be addressed  to explain a fire or explosion. 
 D.1.b.  The Oxidation Reaction 
D.1.c.  Flaming Fires 
D.1.d.  Glowing Fires 
A glowing fire is one in which there is no flame, but the presen ce of very hot 
materials on the surface o f a solid fuel indica tes tha t combustion is occurring.  In this 
type of fire, it is the solid fuel  that is actually burning.  The light emitted by the 
burning object’s surface depends upon  the temp erature of that s urface itself.  In a 
glowing fire, some sort of forced draft is  usually necessary to keep supplying oxygen 
to the fire.  An example is a forced draft charcoal fire. 
D.1.e.  Explosions 
D.1.f.  BLEVE The fundamental chemical reaction in fire is oxidat ion.  In its most simple form, 
oxidation is simply the combining of a tomic oxygen with other elements or 
compounds found in fuel.  When less chem ically stable compounds combine with 
oxygen to form a more stable compou nd (such as carbon monoxide or carbon 
dioxide), the reaction is usually exothermic, me aning that it releases energy, primarily 
in the form of heat.  Most oxidation reactions (an d thus most fires) fall into this 
category.  It is important to note, however , that many other chemical and physical 
reactions (us ually producing or releasing fuel) occur in a fire. 
Fires characterized by flame are the m ost common .  In this type of fire, the flame 
actually is th e fire: it is the gas that is burning.  The light from the flame results from 
the chemi cal reaction of various elements; the color  depends on the specific elements, 
their by-products, and th e tempera ture of the com bustion gases.  In a flaming fire, 
gases in the fuel are releas ed (or created by  the heat), escape, mi x with an oxidizing 
gas such as air, and burn.  An example is an oxy-acetylene torch  flame. 
An explosion is simply a type of fire in which the entire comb ustion occurs in a very 
short period of time.  Generally, vapors, d usts, or gasses are premixed with air in 
precisely the right ratios (to little oxygen or too much will not allow an explosion), 
and the mixture is ignited.  In this type of fire, it is again the gas that is burning.  The 
very fast combustion ca n produce an  enormous release of energy in the form of heat 
and explosive pressure.  Examples include grain dust explosions and petroleum vapor 
explosions. 
When flammable liquids are packaged into airt ight containers or pressure vessels, heat 
or fire can cause pressure caused by the expa nding liquid can prevent its evaporation.  
Effectively, raising the atmospheric pressure in the pressure vessel raises the boiling 
temperature of the liquid.  When a fire c ontinues to  add heat, th e liquid fuel can 
pyrolize, decomposing into highly fla mmabl e vap ors when the liquid is combustible, 
tremendousl y increasing the available fuel lo ad for an explosion.  When the container 
or PV ruptures under the increased internal  pressure, the over-pressurized mixture of 
pyrolized vapors and spontaneously boiling liqu id erupts with explosive forc e.  This 
explosion is known as a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE).  
When the liq uid in the co ntainer or PV is combus tible, a BLEVE may b e immediately 
followed by detonation o f the escapin g combustible vapors. 
 D.2.SEQUENCE OF 
A COMPARTMENT FIRED.2.a.  Introduction 
D.2.b.  Ignition 
D.2.c.  Incipient Stage 
D.2.d.  Free Burning Stage 
As the fire grows and mor e fuel is consumed, enough heat will be produced to ignite 
other materi als in the co mpartment.  The speed  of this horizontal or lateral spread of 
flames depen ds on the density and co mbustibility of the fuels in the comp artment.  In 
general, a significant amount of plume ga sses will be generated, which collect at the 
overhead an d creep downward as they progressively blanket th e compartm ent.  
Temperatures in this smoke/vapor layer will rise d uring the fre e-burning sta ge, 
though temp eratures near  the deck ma y remain rela tively low.  When ventilation in 
the compartment is limited, combustion efficiency will normally decrease, and a fuel 
and oxygen rich vapor layer is produced  above the f lames but beneath th e smoke 
layer at the overhead.  This fuel and oxygen rich layer will build and move lower until 
ignited by open flames or radiation, a mini-e xplosion.  Flares of this fuel and oxygen 
rich layer ca n ignite other fuels and greatly spread the fire.  Once the temper atures in 
the compartment reach a sufficiently high le vel (usually over 1100 degrees F), all the 
materials in the compartment will spontaneousl y ignite (given sufficient oxygen); this 
is “flashover.”   
D.2.e.  Smoldering Stage In general, fires in a com partment wi th a normal fuel load go through four well-
defined stages in their lifetime.  Each s tage has its o wn characteristics and effects on 
the fuels in the compartment.  IOs s hould be aware of these four stages so that th ey 
may accurately assess the stage and pr ogression of a fire through various 
compartmen ts. 
The primary igniter for virtually every fire is  simple  heat.  In general, typical class A 
fires are ignited by hot ob jects (includi ng electrical-resistance heated wires), friction 
(which prod uces heat), radiant heat fr om ex haust flues, static el ectricity, exo thermic 
chemical rea ctions and other sources ignition.  In general, for ignition to occur, the 
heat produced must be ho tter than the “ignition temperature” of the fuel it 
encounters, and sufficient oxygen must be pr esent to sustain the oxidation reaction.   
The incipient stage begins the momen t after  ignition.  In general, the flames a re 
contained an d there is typ ically a free-burning flame.  The com partment wil l generally 
have normal oxygen content (~21%), and tempera ture in the room has not yet begun 
to rise.  As the free-burning flame burns, a plume of hot gasses containing soot, water 
vapor, and solids, will ris e from the flame.   These gasses rise to the overhead and 
displace normal air downward, where the oxygen  fuels the growing fire.  If there is 
fuel above the burning flame, it spread s upward and outward, producing the 
characteristic V-pattern of stains and char. 
As fuel or oxygen is exhausted (oxygen below 16%), open-flame burning diminishes 
or is extinguished.  At thi s point, the fire changes to the glowing combustion, with 
high temperatures continu ing.  Glowing co mbustion can continue to produce fuel-
rich vapors.  Should these vapors suddenly encounter a new sou rce of oxygen, the

COURSE OF THE FIRED.3.a.  Introduction 
D.3.b.  Fires burn upward 
D.3.c.  Insufficient fuel causes a fire to burn out 
D.3.d.  Fires can be diverted by ventilation or radiant 
ignition 
D.3.e.  Vertical spread is enhanced by “ chimneys”
D.3.f.  Downward spread, while less common, can occur 
D.3.g.  Fires generally spread like a hot gas compartmen t can “flashback” in an explosive nature.  In most cases, however, heat 
and oxygen (assuming there is no ventilation) further dissipate and the fire is self-
extinguished. 
The fundamental task in fire investiga tion is reconstructing the sequence of events 
backwards from the ashes .  With the excep tion of explosion-caused fires, almost 
every fire begins with a small flame that spreads.  Accordingly, IOs should focus their 
attention on tracing the s mall flame as it grew into a larger fire.  This section discusses 
general rules of fire behavior  useful in tracing the fire. 
In general, hot gases are lighter than surrounding air, and therefore rise.  Absent 
strong ventilation or a physical barrier, fi res will ge nerally burn upwards, though a 
much lesser degree of downward trav el may also o ccur. 
Fires spread because th ey encounter f uel above or to the side of  them tha t can be 
ignited.  When insufficient fuel is present above a nd to the sid es, the fire is generally 
self-limitin g and will burn out. 
Air currents can deflect a flame, causing the fire to spread in a more horizontal 
fashion than would normally occur (fires burn upward).  When evaluating a fire’s 
spread, the IO must pay close attenti on to all possible sources of air currents.  
Similarly, horizontal surfaces can block a fi re’s upward progress.  When these surfaces 
become extr emely hot, h owever, they may become a secondar y, radiant source of 
ignition for fuels adjacent to them.  In this fashion, fires may progress vertically 
despite a hor izontal barrier.  IOs should be conscious of this possible phenomenon 
and closely consider the p ossibility of ra diant ignition in seconda ry compartm ents. 
Stairways, elevators, air ducts, and so on can carry away heated gasses, providing 
enhanced dr aft for fires.  These chimn ey-lik e arrangements can also serve as a route 
of rapid vertical flame spread.  IOs should  be particularly sensitive to pre-fire 
configuratio ns which may have facilitated the chi mney effect.
Fires usually spread downward when burning solids or liquids fall down onto 
combustible materials, or when surfaces ( usually decks) become so hot that they 
become seco ndary, radiant sources of igni tion for the compartments benea th.  The 
flame damage patterns in downward s pread  situati ons can be confusing, and IOs 
should consider seeking advice from fire investigation experts when they b elieve 
downward s pread may h ave been a si gnificant factor.  In general, the down ward 
spread of a fire will be controlled almost entirely by the amount and type of fuels 
present in th e lower com partment. 
As a broad generalization, fire tends to spread as though it were a hot gas: upward in

D.4.c.  Smoke Horizon 
D.4.d.  Glass relatively straight lines, and outward around barriers. 
When recreating the spread of a fire, IOs must keep in mind that fire suppression 
efforts on one fire front can force the fi re back into other areas  which were not 
involved.  Similarly, fire suppression can force downward sprea d, and even under 
obstacles.  When a protra cted fire-fighting effort was involved, the IO should 
consider the sequence of attacks m ade on th e fire and their possible effects on fire 
spread. 
Predictably, liquids tend to pool in the lowest avail able area.  Because liquids do not 
burn directly (it is the vapors that burn), heavier liquids will tend to “wick” when 
porous solids are available, causing an unusual burn pattern.  Additionally, most solid 
fuel compartment fires leave less burn trace in the corners of the compartm ent 
because th ese areas are d ead air spaces.  In liquid fuel fires, however, burning liquids 
can reach co rners causing a more uniform burn pattern. 
IOs should begin their on-scene inspection by exa mining the external structures in 
order to determine both the limits of the fire damage and the ar eas of heaviest 
damage.  During this walk-through, IOs s hould note sources of ventilation supplying 
the fire area.  Once th e perimeter has b een establish ed, the IO sh ould follow a spiral 
search pattern, working towards the center of the fire.  During the course of the 
search, IOs should note and record using a diagram any dropped  equipment or clear 
signs of fire-fighting e fforts.  In gener al, IOs should follow a fire path from the least 
damaged area to the most damaged area, usually the source of the fire. 
In general, the height at which significant hea t was present in a  compartment can be 
detected by the burning, blistering, or di scoloration of paint and other structural 
materials (the “heat horizon”).  In an unve ntilated compartment, gases will rise and 
distribute uniformly along the overhead, causi ng the heat horizon to be level to the 
floor.  When a heat horizon is not flat, this  is an indication that ventilation or a 
chimney effect was in pla y in the com partment.  IOs must rem ain aware tha t a vessel 
list or ventilation during fire-fighting c an also cause “tipped” heat horizons.  When 
clear heat ho rizons are present in a co mpartment, the IO should consider measuring 
and recording the heat ho rizon on a vertical diagram of the co mpartment.
Similarly, sm oke can discolor or stain wa lls, overheads, and even glass (the smoke 
horizon).  Because smoke rises as a gas, in an unventilated comp artment, the smoke 
horizon will be level with the floor.  Tipped smoke horizons may also be signs of 
ventilation or chimneys.  When clear s moke horizons are presen t, the IO sho uld note 
them separately from the heat horizon. 
Glass can be a valuable indicator of fire sp read.  Although glass appears to be a solid, 
it is in fact a super-cooled liquid.  As a liquid, glass will bow and flex until its internal 
stresses caus e it to shatter .  When glass shatters, either from mechanical imp act or

AND EXPLOSION 
QUESTIONSTo the exten t that such in formation is available, IOs should collect th e following 
information about each fi re and explosion:  
•How was th e ship alerted to the fire? 
•How was th e individual alerted to th e fire? 
•Where did it start? 
•How did it start (if known)? 
•What was th e immediate action taken?
•Condition of fire-fighting equi pment, s upported by dates of 
survey/examination 
•Extinguishers available: 
•Type availabl e in the vicinity; 
•Types available on the ship; 
•Types used 
•Hoses available/used 
•Pumps available/used 
•Was water i mmediately a vailable? 
•Were air vents closed off to the spa ce?
•What was th e nature of the material o n fire and surrounding the fire? 
•Fire retardant specificatio n of bulkheads surrounding the fire 
•Restrictions caused by (a) smoke, (b) h eat, (c) fumes 
•Freedom of access 
•Access availa bility for fire fighting equipment 
•Preparedness of crew - frequency, dur ation, conten t and locatio ns of fire 
musters and drills thermal stress, it breaks in radial and con centric cir cle patterns, producing the familiar 
“spider web” pattern.  Depending on soot or ash deposits on the broken edges of 
glass, the IO can tell when in the sequ ence of the fi re the glass was broken.  Crazed 
(microfactured) glass usually indicates a rapid a flash fire causing rapid thermal change 
and, thus, stress throughout the glass.  Melted glass in windows and light bulb s can 
indicate the direction of fire travel, as gla ss will melt first where it first encounters 
flame, causing it to “belly in” toward th e direction the flame.  When using glass to 
determine th e direction o f flame spread, IOs should assure themselves that the glass 
has not been disturbed during firefighti ng efforts, which would  invalidate an y 
conclusions drawn from it. 
The central questions with regard to electrical  systems in fire investigation are: 1) Was 
conductor/ wiring melting caused by the fire? or 2) Was the fire caused by a n electrical 
failure?  Generally, the IO  should trace the electrical system in a compartmen t 
affected by fire.  Examining the insulation, etc., of the unburned portions of the 
wiring will ty pically reveal clues on these questions.  IOs should also check breakers, 
fuses, and contacts.  Similarly, the IO should remain sensitive to  the electrical devices 
located withi n the comp artment, noti ng their positions in relation to the bu rn pattern 
in the compa rtment.  
 E.1.NAVIGATION

CASUALTIES Generally, the vast majority of navigation type casualties will be detected thr ough 
passive modes as a result of the reporting  requirem ents found in 46 CFR 4.05-1 and 
4.05-10.  However, IOs should pay pa rticul ar atten tion to the in cident histor y of a 
particular vessel, organization, person, facility,  or waterway.  In many cas es, a repeated 
history of accidents by a single company (p erhaps on many ves sels) or a high number 
of casualties on a specific waterwa y may indicate a l atent unsafe condition en demic to 
the compa ny or of that pa rticular location.  Accordingly, IOs are strongly encouraged 
to view their detection efforts within the context o f patterns of incidents.

E.VESSEL NAVIGATION INCIDENTS
Because of the complex nature of some of  these occurrences, IOs are enco uraged to 
seek expert a dvice. 
A collision  is the running of two vessels, both of which are underway, against one 
another.  See Black’s Law Dictionary
An allision  is the running of one vessel into or against a vessel not underway or 
against another object not underway,  including a buoy, pier, piling, dolphin , or other 
fixed structure.  See Black’s Law Dictionary . 
A groundi ng is the drifting, driving, or running  aground of a ship on a shore or a 
strand.  Accidental grounding takes place where a s hip is driven on shore by the 
winds and th e waves.  Voluntary grounding takes place where the ship is run on shore 
either to preserve her from a worse fa te or for some fraudulent purpose.  
It is imperative during the fact-finding st age of an investigation to arrival at the 
casualty site as quickly as possible in orde r to secure the scene, collect evidence and 
interview witnesses.  This is particularly important f or navigation related casu alties 
such as collisions, allision s and groundings.     
In cases of a navigation type casualty, the wheelhou se should be secured as so on as 
possible following the incident.  However, an IO should never  hinder the sa fe 
navigation and maneuver ing of the vessel.  Optima lly, the wheel house should be left 
unchanged until the investigation team  has inspected it.  When this is not possible 
due to the n eed for the vessel to make e ssential and  immediate maneuvers, the scene 
should be documented b y photographs, audi o visual recordings or sketches or any 
other relevan t means avail able with the main objecti ve of preserving vital evidence 
and possibly recreating th e circumstan ces at a later date.  Of particular importance is 
 E.4.b.  Secure Critical Documentary Evidence  
The IO shall, to the best of their ability,  immediately collect and  secure the f ollowing 
critical docu mentary evid ence following a navigation-related ca sualty.  All other 
documentary evidence ca n be gathered at a less cri tical pace du ring the investigation.  
(Collected ev idence shoul d occur in the presence o f a witness.) 
•Charts and Publications   - Collect a nd secure th ose charts us ed in voyage 
planning and transit as well as all applicable Light Lists and Coast Pilots in us e 
at the tim e of the casualty.  This also includes rapid plots or any job aids th at 
might have been used during the evolution of the incident.  
•Course Recorder – Course recorder data should be retrieved with any tim e
difference and gyro repeater error noted.  
•Voyage Data Recorder  
•Engine Control Reco rder (Bell Logger ) – Retrieve data from the recorder
with any tim e differences noted.  Engine control room may also  have a 
separate Eng ine Control Recorder. 
•Bell Books  – Collect both Wheelhous e and Engine Bell Books. 
•Log Books  – Official and rough (working) log books in both the wheelhou se 
and engine control room. 
•Standing O rders and Guidi ng Proc edures – The master will post standing 
orders for all watch officers to abide by.  These will be in terms of both 
general guida nce to follow during a navi gational watch or can be very specific 
regarding a specific navigational watch or evolution expected d uring a

as minimum allowable clo sest point of approach (C PA) for vessel traffic, 
course changes and condi tions when the master sh ould be called to assist th e

•Radar Recorder  – Some radar equipment, such as certain ARPA models, 
may have an internal recording de vice.  Contact the manufacturer for 
instructions on data retri eval. 
•Navigation Equipment  – Some navigation equipment, such a s certain 
models of GPS’s and LO RAN’s, may have an inter nal recording device.  
Contact the manufacturer for instru ctions on data retrieval.   
 Recall and record the navi gational waypoints entered and used during 
the vessel’s transit.  This should be done by a navigational watchstander 
and witnessed by the IO.

 E.4.c.  Collection of Physical Evidence – A Critical 
Eye 
When an IO  first arrives on scene and  proper introductions are complete with the 
vessel master  or ship’s representative, the IO should immediatel y proceed to the 
control stati on used at th e time of the casualty.  This may be referred to as the bridge, 
wheelhouse, pilothouse or steering station.  Once there, the IO should start collecting 
occurrence d ata but shoul d also take ti me to look a t “big picture” items such as the 
general condition and layout of navigational and co ntrol equipment.  IOs should take 
particular note of the following: 
•Watch Standing Statio n – Note wh ere the wa tchstanders co nduct their 
normal routine or duties.
•Visibility – Note the ran ge of visibility from where the navigational 
watchstander  conducts his  or her duties.  Note obstructions or things that 
would hinder their view.
•Windshiel d– Is the wind shield clean and clear?  Is there a usab le wash-down 
system to ro utinely clean the windsh ield?  Are the windshield wipers 
functional and in good condition?  Is the vessel fitted with sun s hades?  Does 
the windshield, by virtue of its design, reflect interior lighting?
•Chart Room or Table – Note the l ocation and l ayout.  Does  it permit eas y
access and allow the wa tch officer to maintain an adequate loo kout?
•Navigation Equipment – Note the l ayout and functionality of the 
navigational equipment.  Can the displ ay information be seen vi sually or 
alarms be heard in the wheelhouse ar ea.
•Posted Job Aids – Often, especially if a vessel has a steady tran sit, the crew 
will create job aids or small working c harts to use instead of the larger, more
cumbersome nautical cha rts.  Check for their use and accuracy.  Also, 
reminders or job aids might be posted  throughout the workplace.  Note any 
that you see as they migh t be indica tive of operational difficultie s or 
problems.  Vessels on a regular run ma y also use a Plexiglas overlay and plot 
positions using a grease pencil.  
•Navigational Procedures or Guida nce – Note the location o f vessel 
operational guidance.  Note its accessibility, ease of use, and apparent signs of 
use such as worn bindings and pages.

E.5.h.  Change Analysis  - What was different this

E.6.DIAGRAMS IOs should make all attempts necess ary to get a graphical representation of what ea ch 
involved party saw durin g the evolution of a casua lty. This is particularly important in 
navigational type casu alties.   
In developing the collision case, the use of diagra ms is highly desirable.  Each 
principal navigation witness should be required to draw a diagram showing the 
relative positions of the two vessels at the time they began navigating with respect to 
each other.  This should be followed by si milar diagrams at other important points in 
the witness ' testimony.  Each diagram should be clearly labeled (e.g., "Relative In many cas ualty cases, p eople are surprised a casualty occurs b ecause th ey have safely 
completed th e task at han d so many ti mes before.  Therefore, IOs should always 
apply ‘Change Analysis’ a nd ask, “what did they do  differently this time” or “what 
conditions were different this time?”

•Lights/day signals carried and operated  in ship, and those seen in  other ship For other navigation casualty typ es, th e use of  diagrams by the witness can be useful 
in visualizing the location of objects in rela tion to o ne another. Their use should not 
be overlooked neither for establishing vessel track lines in collision and grounding 
cases nor for explaining vessel, ma chinery, and piping arrangements. 
Very rarely does a collision occur without fault on the part of one or more of the 
involved vessels.  In most instances, these faults occur because the navigational watch 
officers of one or both vessels depart from the COLREGs beca use they are 
attemp ting to guess the intentions of the other.  IOs must be careful to explore 
departures from the actio ns required by th e COLR EGs.  When a departure i s found, 
the IO should carefully consider communications with the second vessel (if any), and 
should explore the watch officer’s beliefs at the tim e with regard to the secon d 
vessel’s intentions.

F.1.STABILITY F.1.a.  General 
IOs need to have a basic knowledge of stab ility.  However, IOs must also understand 
that this is a complex field of study and they shoul d contact the CG-545 or the 
Marine Safety Center (M SC) for any in-depth stabi lity calculatio ns and/or analysis.  
Stability is the ability of a vessel to retu rn to  its original condition or position, after 
some external force has disturbed it. There are two opposing forces constantly acting 
upon a floating vessel.  The force of gravity (G) acts vertically downward thr ough the 
ship's center of gravity and the cen ter of buoyancy (B) k eeps a v essel afloat a cting 
vertically upward through a vessel.  In general, the stability of a vessel depends 
broadly upon the proper management of these forces. 
Further, other forces such as wind, wa ves and wea ther act on a vessel and also 
influence sta bility.  These forces cause a vessel to move in various ways depending 
upon vessel design, the condition of the vessel loading, and the wind, waves and 
weather.  There are six principal motions of a vessel, each affecting a vessel’s control 
and navigation: 
•Roll - motion about the vessel’s longitudinal axis. 
•Pitch  - motion about the vessel’s transverse axis •Life-saving a ppliances provided and use d, and any difficulties experienced in 
their use
F.STABILITY RELATED INCIDENTS
 •Yaw - motion bout the v essel’s vertical axis 
•Heave  - vert ical bodily motion of the vessel 
•Sway  – lateral, side to side bodily moti on 
•Surge  – longitudinal bodily motion 
In their daily operations, mariners are mostly concerned with roll. 
There are other factors that directly affect stability.  Three more will be discussed: 
•Trim  - The difference between the forward and after drafts, in excess of 
design. 
•List – A state of equilibrium in an inclined position to one side (port or 
starboard). 
•Heel  – To be inclined (ei ther continu ously or momentary) to one side (por t 
or starboard). 
F.1.b.  Stability Incidents 
F.1.c.  Loading Issues / Weight Shifts 
When conducting marine casualty investigat ions of where loading issues or w eight 
shifts were a factor, the following informat ion should be collected, at a minim um: 
•Quantity of weight added or shifted; 
•Location of weight added or distance shifted; 
•Information on list or heel; 
•Draft fore and aft; 
•Trim; 
•Tank levels; and 
F.1.d.  Flooding 
For our purp oses, flooding  is the influx of water pen etrating the watertight en velope of 
a vessel or other structure due to some unintended occurrence.  This can be via 
downflooding or when the hull is breeched. 
Progressive flooding  is uncontrolled flooding. 
Per 46 CFR 28.510, downflooding  is defined as the en try of seawater through any 
opening into the hull or superstructure of an undamaged vessel due to heel, trim or 
submergence of the vessel. In general, trim and list are and can be c ontrolled by ship’s personnel.  Heel is an 
external force placed upo n the vessel.
Stability incidents usually result from loading issues/weight shifts, flooding, o r both.  
These incidents include, but are not li mited to, sinking/capsizing /foundering with 
causal factor s in flooding, icing, loadin g (and  all operations involving loadin g), lack of 
maintaining water/weath er tightness, etc.   See Section E.11 for IMO questions. 
•Additional weight normally maintained  or newly placed on th e vessel.  
 When condu cting marine casualty investigat ions involving flooding, a determination 
must be mad e (primarily by inspecting the watertight envelope) as to whether it was 
downflooding, or the result of a breech  of the water tight envelope.  Following that 
determinatio n, other factors, including the following, should be addressed: 
•Downflooding; 
oLoading 
oWeather 
oCompartmentation / Wa tertight / Weather tight integrity 
maintenan ce 
oPossible flood rate 
oDewatering capabilities 
oFlooding ala rms 
oEvaluation of lifesaving equipment / procedures 
•Flooding (via watertight envelope breech)

F.2.USEFUL 
INFORMATION FOR 
THE IO F.2.a.  Ship’s Hull Markings 
Calculative Draft Marks 
Used for determining displacement and other properties of the ship for stability and 
damage control. These draft marks indicate the dep th of the keel below the waterline. 
Two possible marking systems: 
•Roman numerals 3" in height (prior to 1972) 
•Arabic numerals 6" in height 
Navigational Draft Marks 
Ship’s operating drafts. These draft m arks include the depth of any projectio ns below 
the keel of the ship.  
F.2.b.   Plimsoll Marks (Load lines) 
Plimsoll marks are markings of minimum allowa ble freeboard for registered cargo-
carrying ships. They are located a midships on both the port and  starboard sides of the 
ship. 
Since the req uired minimum freeboard varies with water density and severity of 
weather, different markings are used as in the diagram below: oEvaluation of lifesaving equipment / procedures

G.OCCUPATIONAL INJURY OR DEATH
G.1.GENERAL A qualified medical examiner or coroner usually determines the cause and  manner of 
death.  In general, deaths can result from  wide variety of mech anisms.  This section 
discusses these common causes of death; IOs should examine the sum total of 
evidence to assist or support (or not) the medical examiner or coroner’s findings. 
The Coast Guard will investigate for safety purposes injuries and deaths involving 
existing medical condition s (i.e., heart attack) only in so far as necessary  to assure 
that no aspect of marine operations contributed to the casualty.   
G.3.SUICIDE,
HOMICIDE,ASSAULT 
AND BATTERYThe Coast Guard will not investigate for safety purposes suicide, homicide, or assault 
and battery.  Investigation of these incidents should be carried out as a matter of law 
enforcement, but not under the author ities granted by 46 USC 6301 et seq. This policy 
does not relieve the OCMI from the re sponsibility to conduct such preliminary 
investigation as is necessa ry to determi ne that the i ncident was, in fact, suicide, 
homicide, or assault and battery, and to re fer the case for appropriate actio n. Such 
cases should be recorded as preliminary investigations.   
G.4.DIVING

G.2.EXISTING 
MEDICAL CONDITIONS
G.4.a.  Introduction 
 be a marine casualty und er 46 CFR 4.03-1 only when the death “involves” a vessel.  
The term “involving” is not precisely defined in regulation. 
G.4.b.  Commercial Diving 
The regulations for commercial diving operations are located i n 46 CFR 197.  Diving, 
in general, requires specific equipment,  procedures and techniqu es (SCUBA, surface-
supplied air, or mixed gas ), referred to as  the “diving mode.”  The mode, h owever, 
should not be confused with the commercial or non-commercial nature of the dive.  
For the purposes of marine investigation,  commer cial diving is diving and re lated 
support operations condu cted in conn ection with all types of work and employments, 
including ge neral industry, construction, ship  repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking and 
longshoring.  It does not include :  
•Dives performed solely for instructi onal purposes, using open-circuit, 
compressed-air SCUBA and conducted within the no-decompression limits;  
•Dives performed solely for search, rescue , or related public safety purposes  by 
or under the control of a governmental agency; or  
•Dives performed for scientific purposes (scientific diving) and which is under 
the direction  and control of a scientific diving program. 
G.4.c.  Non-Commercial Diving 
Diving conducted for any purpose other than those outlined in paragraph G.4.b. 
above shall be considered non-commercial.  Recreational SCUBA dives, even when 
commenced from an inspected sm all passeng er vessel and under the supervision of a 
dive master, are considered non-commercia l diving.  A ‘Part 4’ marine casualty 
investigation shall be con ducted for recreati onal di ving involving death or injury of 
persons diving for recrea tional purposes fr om a commercial vessel in federal waters. 
G.4.d.  Diving Mode 
There are 3 basic diving modes: 
•SCUBA Diving - A diving mode indep endent of surface supply in which the 
diver uses open circuit sel f-contained underwater breathing apparatus. 
•Surface Supplied Air Diving - A diving mode in whi ch the diver in the wa ter is 
supplied from the surface dive locati on with com pressed air for breathing. 
•Surface Supplied Mixed Gas Diving - A diving mode in which the diver in the 
water is supp lied from the surface with a breathing gas other tha n air. 
G.4.e.  Fact-Finding - General 
The IO should immediately determine if a diving ac cident is co mmercial or non-
commercial and seek adv ice from expert resources (primarily, the U.S. Navy’s 
Experimenta l Dive Unit).  All equipment associated  with the div e operation s hall be 
collected for possible analysis.  All gauges should be checked an d recorded.  After 
retrieving SC UBA tanks and recording the gauge pressure, close the tank valv e and 
simultaneous ly count the number of full revolutions it takes to  fully close it.  All 
policies and procedures shall also be collected.   
G.4.e.1.  Resources 
The following resources should be con sidered when  an IO desires expert opinion 
 regarding a d iving inciden t:

H.PERSONS MISSING AND PRESUMED DEAD
H.1GENERAL Oftentimes when conducting an investig ation under 46 USC 6301, a perso n’s status 
cannot be confirmed as their physical body (o r remains) cannot be located.  In many 
of these cases, upon the completion of the incident investigation and any subsequent 
search and rescue (SAR) a ction, the fa mily (or someone else) n eeds an official 
document a ttesting to the missing pers on’s official status.  Generally, the 
documentation required is a Death Certificate.  However, a Coroner or Medical 
Examiner will not issue a Death Certifi cate wi thout any positively identified remains.  
As a matter of policy, the U.S. Coast Guar d does not issue Death Certificates.  The 
U.S. Coast Guard may issue a Letter o f Presumed Death. 
H.2LETTER OF 
PRESUMED DEATHA Letter of Presumed Death can be i ssued upon request upon the completion of the 
incident investigation.  As a matter of po licy, before a Letter of Presumed Death can 
be issued, the Search and Rescue Mission Coordinator (SMC), in whose AOR the 
person went missing, must be consulted to d etermi ne the search  status, if any.  See

Dear Nam e:
In acco rdance with Title 46, United States Code, Section 630 1, the United States Coast Guard has 
conducted an investigation into the disappearance of (missing person) during a recreational sport fishing 
dive at (location), on or  about July 11, 1999.  (Missing person) wa s not found in the ensuing search and 
is presum ed dead. 
The United States Coas t Guard does not issue Death Certificates.  A Coroner or Medical Exam iner 
issues a Death Certificate after rem ains have been  found or positiv ely identified.  Since no rem ains have 
been found, this letter docum ents the loss and presum ptive death of (m issing person) in lieu of a Death 
Certif icate.   
The U.S. Coast Guard activity num ber and cas e number for the investigation into the disappearance of 
(missing person) are Activity #________ / Case #________.  A copy of the investigation can be 
obtained by subm itting a Freedom  of Inform ation Act Request to Comm andant (G-SII), 2100 Seco nd

Pollution Incident 
Investigation  
 
THIS PAGE IN TENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK 
 A.1.
INTRODUCTIONThis chapter provides policy for pollution incide nt investigat ions.  In gene ral, th e COTP 
or OCMI shall conduct pollution incident in vestigations to determine the causes not only 
of the pollution but also of the incident causing the pollution.  Pollution incident 
investigations should not be conducted solely to determine civil or cr iminal liability.  In 
general, all re ported pollution incidents within Coast Guard jurisdiction, re gardless of size, 
should be investigated.  Pollution incident investigations should include an attempt to 
determine: 
•whether a di scharge/release has in fact occurred or whether a p otential 
discharge/release is likely to occur;  
•whether th e Coast Guard  has jurisdicti on over that discharge/release;  
•the source of the discharge/release and the potentially responsible party; and 
•whether th e discharge/release is a violation of law or regulatio n.
A.2.ENFORCEMENT 
ACTIONS FOLLOWING 
INVESTIGATIONMost Coast Guard investigations are pu rsued under multiple law enforcement 
authorities.  Accordingly, investigations ar e not ad ministrative, civil, or criminal; they 
are fact-finding activities.  However, u pon completion of an investigation, the 
OCMI/COTP/FOSC w ill decide whether or not sufficient proof of a violation has 
been identified and docu mented to proceed with enforcement action(s) and , if so, the 
appropriate type of enforcement actio n(s) to be un dertaken, wh ich may incl ude 
criminal, civil, administrative, or any combin ation of the three.  Proof of a violation 
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) is considered sufficient only 
when all five elements defining a violati on have been identified and documented.  
These elements are: 
1.a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance; 
2.from a known source (ves sel, facility, etc.); 
3.with a known Responsible Party (i.e. owner, operator, person-in-charge); 
4.into or upon the navigable waters of the United States; and 
5.creating a sheen, sludge, film, or emulsion or meeti ng the Reportable 
Quantity (R Q) requirements of 40 CFR 117. A.GENERAL
Every incident reported a nd subsequent investigation shall be properly enter ed in 
MISLE.  Doing so documents the in cident and al lows for appropriate tracking and 
measuremen t of prevention and enforcement activi ty which is critical to program 
evaluation. 
When all five elemen ts of a violation have been id entified, appropriate enforcement 
action shall b e taken.  During the course of  the investigation, other deficiencies or 
violations (e.g. missing or inoperable po llution prevention equipment) may al so be 
identified.  Sufficient identification an d documenta tion of the jurisdictional and 
factual elements for these deficiencies and violations should be completed before any

RELATIONSHIP TO 
MARINE CASUALTY 
INVESTIGATION
B.1.PURPOSE
B.2.LEVELS OF 
INVESTIGATIVE 
EFFORTIn 1995, the Quality Action Team on Marine  Safety Investigations suggested that 
three levels o f investigation exist.  This section defines and implements th e levels of 
investigation for pollutio n incidents: 
•Preliminary Investigations  are initial investigative efforts undertaken to 
ascertain whether a repor t is genuine, how severe the incident is or will 
become, wh ether the Coa st Guard has  jurisdiction, whether oth er agencies o r
offices must be notified, and what level of Coast Guard investigative effort is 
necessary. 
•Data Collection Activities  do not require any significant investigative effo rt, 
and usually consist only of collecting an d entering basic factual information 
into MISLE for future reference and an alysis and, when applicable, referral 
for enforcement action (s).
B.3.CONDUCT OF 
INVESTIGATIONS AND 
DOCUMENTATION 
REQUIREMENTSB.3.a.  General   
The following guidance provides instructi ons and criteria for conducting and 
documenting  the various levels of pollution incident investigations based on the 
definitions provided in Section B.2. 
B.3.b.  Preliminary Investigations 
Allnotifications/reports of pollution incidents (i.e. discharges or releases as defined 
in 40 CFR 300.5) shall be  documented in  MISLE Notification records except for: enforcement action is co nsidered. 
Where a pollution incident results from, contributes to, or qualifies as a reportable 
marine casua lty as defined  in 46 CFR 4.05-1, the pollution and casualty inves tigations 
shall be cond ucted and do cumented as a sing le investigation in MISLE. In that the 
majority of pollution incidents include both investigative and response acti vities, both 
the incident and the incid ent management  will be conducted and documented in 
MISLE.  Marine casualty and pollution inve stigators should arrange a division of 
responsibilities early in the investigation to avoid duplication of effort and 
expeditiously complete th e investigation. 
B.DETERMINING LEVELS OF INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT FOR 
POLLUTION INCIDENTS
This section provides guidance for th e inve stigation, reporting, and record keeping 
processes ass ociated with pollution incident investigations 
•Informal Investigations  and Formal Investigations are mor e exhaustive 
investigative efforts and are not ge nerally required, unless the pollution 
incident is a part of a marine casua lty as defined in 46 CFR, Part 4. 
 •notifications from the National Response Center (NRC) in whi ch it is 
obvious the Coast Guard  has no investigative or response jurisdiction, and 
•notifications relayed from other Coast Guard units (as they shou ld already 
exist in MISLE). 
No data en try beyond th e MISLE Notification is required if the preliminary 
investigation reveals that:
1.the incident i s a mystery spill and the Coast Guard takes no acti on (response, 
investigation, or otherwise); 
2.the incident i s outside of the Coast Gu ard’s investigative jurisdiction; 
3.the incident can not be v erified or is proven erroneous; 
4.the incident does not meet the R eportabl e Quantity (RQ) criter ia of 40 CFR 
117.3 o r 40 CFR 302.4; or 
5.the incident i s a National Pollution Di scharge Elimination System (NPDES) 
authorized di scharge or release. 
In these cas es, units shall enter the following minimum information in the 
Notification record: 
•Incident deta il/location ta b:  the incident type, notif ication meth od, incident 
date/time, n otification date/time, and the incident l ocation; 
•Reporting Party tab:   the name and phone number  of the reporting party; 
•Involved Subjects tab:   the waterway entered as a referential involved subject; 
and 
•Incident Des cription tab:   brief description of the incident and o ne of the five 
reasons above that no inv estigation beyond a preliminary investigation was 
conducted. 
B.3.c.  Data Collection Activities 
 A data collection activity shall be con ducted and d ocumented f or any reported 
pollution incident where the preliminary investigation indicates that: 
•the five elements of a Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) 
violation detailed in enclosure (1) are identified; or 
•the source of the discharge or releas e is unknown (mystery) bu t the Coast 
Guard will take some acti on (i.e. response). If the preliminary investigation reveals so mething other than the five situations 
described above, the unit should undert ake the a ppropriate level of investigative 
effort to complete th e investigation and continue documenta tion in MISLE from the 
MISLE Notification through to the Incident  Investigation Activity and Enfo rcement 
Activity, as a ppropriate.  
 Documentati on of a data collection level in vestigation of a pollution incident shall 
include: 
•A MISLE notification; 
•An incident i nvestigation activity (IIA) with: 
 if known, the source vessel or facility entered (or mapped in from 
the case) as a  referential involved subject (“other” involved subjects 
in MISLE are entered no n-referentially); 
 if known, the responsible party entered (or mapped in from the 
case) as a referential involved party; 
 the waterway segment in which the di scharge occu rred entered (or 
mapped in from the cas e) as a referential involved waterwa y; 
 if the source is known, a Damage to the Environment even t timeline 
entry with a Discharge Details filed; 
 if the source is unknown (mystery) and  the Coast G uard takes some 
action, a Marine Environment conditi on timeline entry with Mystery 
Details filed; 
 a Marine Environment condition timeline entry with a Condition 
Type of “Waterway Cond ition” and Environmental Damage Details 
filed; 
 a Marine Environment condition timeline entry with a Condition 
Type of “Marine Environment” and Marine Environment Details 
filed; and 
B.3.d.  Informal and Formal Investigations 
For some large-scale vessel-source pollution incidents, the pollution investigation 
coincides with a marine casualty inves tigation.  When a single incident spawns 
multiple investigations, they will all be capt ured in the same MISLE Case and incident

REQUIRED FOR 
INCIDENTS REPORTED 
TO THE IMO Pollution resulting fro m an incident 
•Type of pollutant. 
•UN number/IMO hazard class (if applicable). 
•Type of pack aging (if applicable). 
•Quantity on board. 
•Quantity lost. 
•Method of stowage and s ecuring. 
•Where stowed and quanti ties in each compartment/container. 
•Tanks/spaces breached. 
•Tanks/spaces liable to be breached. 
•Action tak en to prevent further loss. 
•Action tak en to mitigate pollution. 
•Dispersant/ neutralizer u sed, if any. Pollution investigations th at only reach  the preliminary level of investigation require 
none of the marine investigation process be compl eted beyond adequate fact-finding 
to determine that no further Coast G uard effort is required. 
Pollution investigations th at reach th e data collection level of investigation require the 
generating of a timeline with only eno ugh information to meet the minimum  data 
entry requirements for MISLE as detailed in the MISLE Process Guides. 
Pollution investigations do not generally reach the i nformal or formal level of 
investigation without being involved in a ma rine casualty.  These investigations will 
follow the policy set forth in Section B.2. of Chapter B7 of this Volume. 
C.MARINE CASUALTIES INVOLVING POLLUTION INCIDENTS 
REPORTED TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION (IMO)
When such information can reasonabl y be obtained, the following information (in 
addition to the information required in Chapter B 7 of this Volume) must b e
contained in a the ROI which will be  forwarded by CG-545 to the IMO: 
•Restricting boom used, if any. 
 D.1.PURPOSE
D.2.DEFINITIONS The following definitions are applicabl eto evidence required for civil penalty 
prosecution: 
•Direct evid ence  is that evidence whi ch in itself  (without need f or inferences 
or reasoning) proves  the source of the discharge orshows  the pa th of the 
discharge, such as a witn ess statement about the dis charge, or pictures and 
video showing the path from the source to th e water. 
•Circumstantial evidence  is that evidence which does not in itself prove  the 
source of the discharge or show  the pa th, but which does show an 
association, such as when a given vessel carries black oil and the slick was 
black oil, or where slick samples match a suspected source.

ESTABLISH THAT A 
POSSIBLE SOURCE IS 
THE VIOLATING 
VESSEL OR FACILITY 
WITH A KNOWN 
RESPONSIBLE PARTYTo properly establish that a ‘possible source’ is the violating “vessel or facility with a 
known RP,” one of the following sets of criteria must be met:  
•Optimal Di rect Evidence Case
1.The path of the RP’s source oil to the water, and 
2.The RP admits to being the source, or
3.Pictures and/or video showing the pa th from the source to the water, or
4.The PI witnesses the discharge. 
•Minimal Di rect Evidence Case
1.The path of the RP’s source oil to the water, and 
2.A witness to the discharge stating the s ource. 
•Circumstantial Evidence Case
1.The path of the RP’s source oil to the water, and 
2.A conclusive match between the slick and the RP’s source oil.

D.5.ADDITIONAL 
REQUIREMENTS /
INFORMATION 
REGARDING EVIDENCEThe following requirements / information provide additional detail regarding the 
previously mentioned evi dence: 
•The PI must verify the RP’s primary address (the b est address to use by the 
CGHO for correspondence) prior to initiating any enforcement action. 2.Conclusive non-matches between all other possible sources and the slick. 
 •The ‘path’ m ust be descri bed in the PI statem ent or  have a marked vessel or 
facility plan scanned showing the path. 
•When an RP admits to a discharge, it must be incl uded in a witness statement. 
•When a PI witnesses a dis charge, it must be included in the PI statemen t. 
•When a witn ess observes a discharge, it must be included in a witness statem ent. 
•When there i s a conclusive match or n on-match, th e MSL report must be 
included. 
•When there i s a conclusive match, sa mples should be collected at multiple p oints 
throughout the path, when able. 
•When there are conclusive non-matches wi th other  possible sources, the process 
of identifying other possible sources must be described in the PI statement. 
E.1.PURPOSE
E.2.WHEN TO 
TAKE SAMPLESThe following information describes when a PI should conduct pollution sampling: 
•Environmental Crimes:   Sampling shall be cond ucted when there is credible 
evidence of an environmental crime.  PIs must be familiar with the elements 
of the various environmental crimes a s described in COMDTINST 
M16201.1; Criminal Enforcement of Environmental Laws and COMDTINST 
M16247.1 (series); Maritime Law Enforcement M anual, Chapter 9; and 
Chapter C8 of this Volume. 
•Signi ficant Spill Vol ume Cases:   Sampling of the source (tan ks, piping, etc.) 
as well as various locations where the s pill may have traveled/impacted 
should be conducted on s pills where extensive clean up operations are 
expected, ev en when th e PI has strong  direct evidence of the s ource of the 
discharge.  This is important for deter mining if spill samples collected after 
the original spill samples are derived from the same source. 
•Optimal Direct Evidence Cases:  Sampling is not generally necessary when
the PI has strong direct evidence of  the source of the discharge.   •When no other possible sources are identified, it should be described in the PI 
statem ent. 
E.DETERMINING APPROPRIATE POLLUTION SAMPLING ACTION
This section provides guidance for PIs regarding pollution sampling during the 
course of any investigation involving po llution.  In general, the OCMI/COTP may 
elect not to sample in any instance wh ere he or she has determi ned that enforcement 
action is unn ecessary. 
 •Minimal Di rect Evidence Cases:   Sampling is advisable when  the PI has 
direct eviden ce of the dis charge, but th at evidence is minimal.  Weak direct 
evidence incl udes a single witness statement reporti ng the source or two 
pieces of evidence th at seem to con tradict one another as to the source, such 
as a photograph and contradicting witness testimony. 
E.3.WHERE TO 
TAKE SAMPLESThe following information describes where a PI should conduct pollution sampling: 
•Smaller Vessels:   Smaller vessels typically discharge through a simple bilge 
suction and overboard discharge system.  Small vessels with 
compartmentation, however, may have multiple pumps and overboard 
discharges.  When sampling a smaller vesse l, it is important to sample each 
independentl y discharging bilge space where oil or oily water is found.   
Samples of fuel may also be taken.  In all instances, PIs should c onsider the 
type of oil discharged when determini ng sampling locations. 
•Deep Draft Vessels:   Many oil spills from deep-draft vessels originate from 
marine casua lties.  This includes groundings where there is abun dant direct 
evidence of the discharge.  This evidence includes p hotographs of ruptured 
shell plating, cargo or bunker tank soundings, photographs of t he emerging 
slick, videotape and the li ke.  When sampling a deep draft vessel consider the 
following:   
Bilge Systems:   When deep draft vessel oil spills a re not the result of a 
casualty, Coast Guard investigations have generally implicated the oily 
water separa tor (OWS) / bilge discharge system.  Accordingly, PIs should 
focus their attention on th e engineroom bilge system in deciding where to 
take samples.   Typically, deep draft vessels draw suction from the bilge 
but store the oily water m ixture in slop / sludge tanks.  Using the OWS, 
separated oil is stored in slop / sludge / waste oil ta nks where it is 
pumped ashore or burned aboard ship.  This general set up will require a 
PI to consider sampling: 
“Clean” water from outboard of the OWS (where available); 
Oily water from inboard of the OWS; 
Oily water from each segr egated bilge area; and 
Oily water or  concentra ted oils from each slop / sludge / waste oil •Circumstantial Evidence Cases:   Sampling shall be conducted when the PI 
has no direct evidence of the source of th e discharge. In such ca ses, the RP is 
typically iden tified through the possible route of oil and oil sample analysis 
matches. 
 tank. 
Ballast Systems:   Although relatively rare, some vessels are fitted with 
ballast piping arrangements that could allow ballast in fuel or cargo oil 
tanks, or that could allow oily water in ballast tanks.  PIs must consider 
the specific bilge / ballast segregation arrangements aboard the ship, copy 
and review ballast records, and determi ne wheth er water / oily water 
samples should be taken from the balla st tanks.  Where segregation is not 
completely i ndependent, the PI should consider sampling: 
“Clean” water from outboard of the discharge monitor (where 
available); 
Oily water from inboard of the discharge monitor; 
Water/oily water from each ballast ta nk; and 
Oily water / slop / sludge  from  each involved cargo tank. 
Cargo Systems:   Cargo system spills usually occur during trans fers, but 
can occur at other times (particularly following internal tank-to-tank cargo 
transfers).    Such spills also have resulted from “over the top” tr ansfers 
which are prohibited.  Where cargo is suspected, each cargo tank should 
be independ ently sampled. 
E.4.HOW TO TAKE 
SAMPLESOil samples taken during a pollution investig ation shall be taken in accorda nce with 
the MSL Oil Spill Sample Handling and Transmittal Guide, and a proper chain of 
custody shall  be maintain ed.  Coast G uard fi eld un its shall not maintain duplicate (or 
‘back up’) oil samples.  All oil samples that are collected by Co ast Guard field units 
for analysis shall be sent to the MSL as soon as possible following their collection.  
The longer an oil sample is maintained at a Coast Guard field un it prior to sending it 
to the MSL, the less likely the possibility w ill be of determining a sample match.  
Duplicate oil  samples mai ntained by C oast Guard field units tha t are analyzed after 
the original sample may o verturn a previously determined sampl e match. •“The Spill:”  In general, especially for larger spills, s ampling towards the mid-
point (if possible) and at the leading edges of a spill is advised as it shows 
weathering tr ends.  Also, additional sa mpling of impacted areas can be useful 
to determine if the oil is from the orig inal responsible party or if the spill has 
become a “spill of opportunity.” 
Confirmation Samples: In some instances, it may be necessary to take a second 
sample from a suspect so urce for separate analys is by a state or other agency should 
the original sample be found to match a slick.  Confirmation samples are never for 
Coast Guard  purposes and shall not be stored or maintained by Coast Guard field 
 E.5.HAZMAT
F.1.GENERAL
G.1.GENERAL One important function of an investigati on of pollution discharge during a response 
is to provide the Federal On-Scene C oordinator with information about the areas 
impacted by a spill.  This also serves other investigation purposes in that it helps to 
establish that the spill occurred on or impa cted a navigable waterway of the United 
States and documents the extent of the spill impacts.  Shoreline assessment is an 
activity taken under the National Conti ngency Plan evaluating damage caused  by the 
spill to economic and environmental resources.  As such, shoreline assessment should 
properly be executed in conjunction with the na tural resource trustees’ dam age 
assessment a ctivities (see 40 CFR 300. 615(c)(3)(I) a nd (d)(4)).  Natural Reso urce 
Trustees such as the Dep artment of the Interior and the Natio nal Marine Fisheries 
Service possess biological, geophysical, and toxicological expertise that PIs will not 
routinely have.  Accordin gly, PIs should limit their input to shoreline assessm ent to:  
•a thorough physical description of the waterwa y affected;  
•descriptions of the specific areas affect ed by a disch arge, including the exact 
location, thickness of oil, etc.; 
•a tabulation (raw count) o f any directly affected eco nomic and/o r 
environmental resources (wildlif e) affected by the d ischarge  with no units.  Before taking confirmation sample s, the PI should have a clear reason for 
doing so, suc h as a reques t by state investigators to perform confirmation tests using 
a state laboratory.  MSL c an provide portions  of the original samples to req uesting 
parties, if authorized by the PI. 
Currently, only properly qualified response personnel from the Coast Guard National 
Strike Force may take hazardous mater ials samples.  All other Coast Guard personnel 
are prohibited from taking such samples.  If another agency takes hazardous materials 
samples for analysis, obtain a copy of their report.  For informational purposes, the 
FBI, EPA, o r other state,  local, (possi bly commercial) laboratories will have to 
conduct th e analysis.  The Marine Safety Laborato ry (MSL) does not analyze anything 
other than oi l. 
F.NATURAL SOURCE DISCHARGE
Natural source discharges are generally investigated to ensure tha t the dischar ge does, 
in fact, generate from a natural source.  These natural sources are usually large veins 
of oil located beneath the ocean floor.  Due to the s hifting of plates (underwa ter 
earthquakes) or pressure build up, they o ccasionall y discharge varying quantities of 
crude oil (or other substa nces).  If there is any question as to whether the so urce is a 
natural source, treat th e pollution incident investigation as if it were an unk nown 
source discharge. 
G.ASSESSING SHORELINE IMPACTS
 
############
 
 the size of th e particles in the sedimen t.  On beaches with large particles, water 
quickly percolates down through the beach se diment and very little material  is washed 
seaward with  the backwash.  This creates a beach wi th a steep profile.  When a beach 
has smaller sediment particles, the beach is more waterlogged and the back wash will 
be greater.  Thus, beach es with small er part icles a re generally flatter in profile.  The 
degree to wh ich the shoreline experiences violent waves and tida l swings (exposure), 
however, is also a factor.  Using all of  these factors, beaches can generally be 
categorized a s being reflective or dissipative.  Reflective  beaches are characterized by 
coarse sands, small waves, steep slopes,  small tidal ranges, short wave periods, harsh 
swash conditions, and relatively impoverished fauna.  Dissi pative beaches, however, 
generally have fine sand, large waves, sha llow slopes, high tidal ranges, long wave 
periods, harmless swash conditions, and rich fauna. 
G.5.c.  Rocky Shore Intertidal Zones 
Ecologists have intensely studied zonati on on various beaches since the late 1940s.  
Generally sp eaking, the intertidal zon e can be tho ught of as being composed of three 
major zones:
•a broad middle shore zo ne called the eulittoral zo ne characterized by 
suspension-feeding barnacles, mussels, or sometimes oysters; and  
•a narrow low-shore zone called the sublittoral fringe  located b elow the low 
tide line but still influenc ed by tides and waves characterized by red algae, 
large kelps and sea squirts.  
(Raffaelli and Hawkins, Intertidal Ecology , 1996). 
G.5.d.  Rocky Cliffs and Bedrock Shores 
The most ex posed rocky shores are rocky cliffs and bedrock shores.  On thes e shores 
the littoral fringe typically has small snails , bluegreen algae, and encrusting lichens.  
The black stripe of bluegreen algae is very common  and quite distinctive.  The 
eulittoral zone is dominated by encrust ing suspension feeders such as mussels and 
barnicles.  Seaweeds in th e eulittoral zone tend to f orm short turf.  The sublittral zone 
along the colder, nutrient rich shores typica lly contains large kelp and algal turfs, such 
as the species-rich kelp forests of the southwester n pacific. (Raffaelli and H awkins, 
Intertidal Ecology , 1996).
G.5.e.  Boulder Shores 
Boulder shores have man y of these sa me distributional patterns , but have ad ded 
biological ric hness provided by the many overhang and crevice micro-habitats.  The 
large spaces between bou lders provide  an ex cellent habitat for crabs and gastropods.  
These beach es are often mixtures of partic le sizes  with boulders mixed with finer 
grained gravels, sands, or even held to gether by mussel byssus threads (as on the 
Atlantic coas ts). •a high shore area someti mes called th e littoral fringe characterized by 
encrusting lichen, bluegreen bacteria, small snails and periwinkles;  
 (Raffaelli and Hawkins, Intertidal Ecology , 1996). 
G.5.f.  Gravel Shores 
Gravel shores also have the general rocky shore distributional pattern, thoug h not in 
the abundan ce of living things found on rocky cliff, bedrock, or boulder shores.  
Often, gravel beaches are considered barre n becaus e they offer little protecti on from 
exposure and but the par ticle sizes are too large to retain swash water.  
(Raffaelli and Hawkins, Intertidal Ecology , 1996). 
G.5.g.  Sandy and Mudflat Intertidal Zones 
Ecologists have destructi vely examined sandy beaches and mud flats (becaus e most 
organisms live beneath the surface) since the ea rly 1950s.   While  several systems have 
been propos ed for describing the ecol ogical zones within the intertidal zone,  no 
single framework has em erged as the universally accepted stan dard.  One system 
divides the beach into fou r zones:  
•the dry sand zone;  
•the water retention zone  which is farther downshore and is damp but not 
wet at lo w tide;  
•the area of resurgence  which is further still downshore and in which inter-
particle water flows in and out of the sediment with the tide; an d  
•the permanently satura ted zone in which there i s little excha nge of water 
over the tidal  cycle.   
•While having the benefit of being read ily identified visually, this system 
provides little information about the f lora of the various zones.  An alternate 
zone system suggests that there are thr ee zones:  
•one high zone in which only air breathing animals exist;  
•a middle zone.    
In general it can be said that the sp ecific distribution of life along a fine-particle 
intertidal shore depends o n the exposu re of th e shore, the size o f the particles, and 
the stability of the sediments.  
(Raffaelli and Hawkins, Intertidal Ecology , 1996). •low zone in which only truly aquatic a nimals exist; and  
G.6.ESTUARY 
TYPES AND 
CIRCULATION 
PATTERNSG.6.a.  Introduction 
The word “estuary” comes from the Latin word aestus , meaning tide and the adjective 
aestuarium , meaning tidal.  Intuitively, an estuary is the area wher e fresh water  meets 
salt water at an inlet of the sea.  R.W. Fairbrid ge (1980) gives a much more rigorous 
definition, however: “An estuary is an  inlet of the sea reaching into a river valley as 
far as the upper limit of tidal rise, usually being divisible into three sectors: (a) a 
marine or lower estuary, i n free connection with the open sea; (b) a middle estuary, 
subject to str ong salt and freshwater m ixing; and (c) an upper of fluvial estuary

INTRODUCTION
A.2.ENFORCEMENT 
FOLLOWING A 
PERSONNEL 
INVESTIGATIONAll Coast Gu ard investigations are pursued under the multiple law enforcem ent 
authorities granted to the agency.  Accordin gly, investigations are not admini strative, 
civil, or criminal; they are a fact-finding mission.   Upon completion and based upon 
the facts of the investigation, the COTP/OCMI and the District Commander will 
decide upon the appropriate enforcement action (if any), which may be crimi nal, civil, 
or administrative, or any combination.   Accordingly, all investigations may be said to 
potentially be “criminal” investigations, thou gh as a matter of policy an IO s hall not 
begin a personnel investigation with a pr esumption regarding c riminal or civil 
offenses. 
A.3.STEPS IN 
CONDUCTING A 
PERSONNEL 
INVESTIGATIONIn general, the following steps a pply to all personnel investigations: 
Step One:    Detection o f Incidents; 
Step Two:    Fact Finding; 
Step Three: Identify Laws and Regulations in Force; 
Step Four:     Review the People Involved; 
Step Five:      Consider Human Error; 
Step Six:       Consider Omissions; 
Step Seven:   Consider the Evidence f or Each Element; and
Step Eight:    Report Alleged Violations. A.PERSONNEL INVESTIGATIONS
Violations by personnel of statutes and re gulations enforced by the Coas t Guard can 
result in criminal or civil penalties taken against the person and/or administrative 
proceedings or other alternative admin istrative acti on against merchant mari ners' 
credentials (MMCs) issued to the person by the Coast Guard.  Procedures for 
processing civil penalty violations, eviden ce of criminal violations and enforcement 
tools available to the Officer in Charge,  Marine Inspection (OC MI) and Captain of 
the Port (COTP) are discussed in Part C of this volume.  This chapter provides policy 
guidance for conducting personnel investig ations.  Personnel investigations are 
conducted to  promote safety on th e high seas  and the navigable waters of the United 
States, and to prevent or mitigate personnel related  hazards to li fe, property, and the 
marine environment.   
IOs shall under no circumstances indicate  that an investigation is “non-c riminal” 
or “only administrative.”  If questioned by a witness or involved person regarding 
legal or civil liability, the IO shall respond with wo rds to the effect that “it is 
inappropriate for me to give you legal advice, but you are free to confer with counsel 
if you wish.”  While it is generally unn ecessary to explain enforcement co nsequences 
of a personnel investigation, IOs shall explai n, if questioned, that the government is 
free to initiate criminal, civil, or administrative enforcement a ctions based on  the facts 
of the case, a nd that takin g one enforcement a ction  does not preclude the oth ers. 
NOTE:  Causal analysis is not normally a part of a personnel investigation.  
 B.1.GENERAL
B.2.DETECTION 
METHODSThe following list outlines the various ways tha t the Coast Guar d detects in cidents: 
Reports From the Public; 
Active Surveillance / Detection Operations; 
Reports from Other Coast Guard Units; 
Reports from Other La w Enforcem ent Agencies ; and 
Reports from Foreign G overnments and th e Inter national Maritime Organization. Accordingly, IOs should perform the fact finding process discussed chapter B3 of 
this volume, along with the violation analysis discussed in chapter B5.  IOs may 
conduct hu man error analysis as describe d in chapter B4 when they believe such 
information will be of value in considering the appropriate enforcement action.   
B.STEP ONE:DETECTION OF INCIDENTS
In general the majority of detections o f incidents leading to personnel investigations 
come from passive detecti on.  A majority of this type of detecti on is reported by the 
public, and is often an investigation that ru ns with some other i ncident inves tigation 
(i.e. marine casualty).  Personnel investigations stemming from vessel casualti es 
should begin as soon as possible and should not await the completion of the marine 
casualty report of investigation (ROI).   If someone conducts the personnel 
investigation other than the IO condu cting  the ma rine casualty investigation, close 
coordination between the two will be necessary. 
See Chapter B2 of this volume for the speci fics on each detectio n method.  Generally 
speaking, there is nothing specific to personnel investigations with regard to detection 
methods, ho wever, more common detecti on meth ods and supporting information 
are listed bel ow. 
B.3.REVIEW OF 
LOGBOOK ENTRIESB.3.a.  Official Logbook Entries 
B.3.b.  Criteria For Investigation One source of complaints will be Official  Logbooks.  Coast Guard marine safety 
personnel should take every opportunity to examin e vessel logs submitted to  Coast 
Guard offices or when on board a com mercial vessel.  In this regard, liaison with 
shipping agents and local  company representa tives can be ben eficial with regard to 
alerting IOs to shipboard problems and arrang ing visits to arriving vessels.  Official 
Logbooks m ust be maintained as specifie d in 46 USC 11301.  Additional guidance is 
provided in the Official Logbook (Form CG 706B) and Navigation and Vess el 
Inspection C ircular (NVI C) 1-86 . 
Official logbooks should be reviewed by th e final port of voyage in a timely manner 
to determine if actionable offenses occu rred during the voyage.  Not every en try 
logged against a mariner should be considered a co mplaint.  Only when thos e entries 
showing a compromise of safety or ha zard to life, property, and/or the mar ine 
environment or when the seaman has a hi story of repeated offenses should an 
investigation be initiated.

AS A METHOD OF 
DETECTING 
INCIDENTSB.4.a.  Written Complaints 
B.4.b.  Telephoned Complaints 
B.4.c.  Disclosure Of Defects and Protection of 
Informants 
The value of identifying and reporting hazardous or unsafe conditions by concerned 
mariners to the Coast Gu ard has long b een recognized.  Under 46 USC 3315, Coast 
Guard personnel are prohibited from disclosing, e xcept as authorized by the 
Secretary, th e name of an  individual who reports vessel defects or imperfections in 
matters subj ect to regulations and inspections.  This nondisclosure policy has for 
some time b een extend ed to unlicensed persons as well.  Additionally, 46 USC 2114 
protects sea man from recrimination for notifying the Coast Gu ard of unsafe 
conditions or practices.   Log entries should be reviewed to ensure that th ey have been m ade in compl iance 
with applica ble law.  If they have not, the ma ster should be advised to the deficiencies 
to prevent recurrence in future entries.  Since a log entry can, un der some 
circumstances, serve as sufficient evidence to prove a complaint in subsequent S&R 
proceedings, masters sho uld be encou raged to provide ample information in the 
logbook, eve n to the point of making a special entry or attaching additional 
statem ents r eceived during the master’s investigation.  When interacting with vessel 
masters, the i mportance o f attaching statem ents tak en by the ma ster and referring 
them in log entries so that they will be accep ted as parts of the log when presented as 
evidence sho uld be carefully explained.  See figures B9-1 and B9-2 for sample 
logbook review checklists. 
Receipt of a ny letter of complaint co ncerning a mariner is sufficient reason to 
commence a personnel investigation.  Some fo rm of acknowledgment of receipt shall 
be made as s oon as practi cable. 
A telephoned complaint i s sufficient to commence a personnel investigation.  If 
possible, the IO should note the iden tity of the call er and the in formation received. 
As a matter of policy, most of our reports  are “public information” and, therefore, 
releasable to the public un der the Freedom  of Information Act (FOIA). Sea man that 
are protected  from disclosure will be enter ed into the MISLE computer system as a 
confidential source and will not be na med (will be REDACTED by CG-5453) in 
anything that is releasable (i.e. the repo rt of investigation (ROI)).   Additionally, the 
seaman will not have any Party Associations within MISLE.  Instead, any variation of 
the following statement s hould be used, “The Coast Guard received confidential 
information concerning…”  Additionally, re view the information gathered to ensure 
that th ere are no obvious implications as to the so urce.  References to a p erson 
covered by this paragraph should be avoide d; however, if a reference must be made, 
the individual shall be referred to as the confi dential source .

C.1.SCOPE OF 
FACT FINDING
C.2.EVIDENCE C.2.a.  General 
C.2.b.  Initial Fact Finding Investigative Efforts 
Upon receipt of a complaint, sufficient information should be obtained to determine 
the proper method and scope of investigation.  Wanted List should be check ed in all 
cases.  If a verbal compla int is received, probing questions may be sufficient.  If the 
complaint is written, review of local file s, communi cations with Headquarter s, and 
other activiti es may be h elpful in generating sufficient information.  The information 
initially received will determine what m ethod the IO will pursue for further 
investigation. 
C.2.c.  Additional Efforts Occasionally, information needed for a pe rsonnel investigation must be obtained 
from a U.S. Consul; this may include co urt or med ical records.  OCMI's are 
authorized to correspond directly with U.S. Consuls for the purpose of requesting 
routine records needed for personnel investigations.  In many instances, however, the 
Consul may be reluctant to release info rmation without specific authority from 
superiors or he or she ma y have difficulty obtaining such records.  In such cases, the 
Office of Investigations and Analysis,  Commandant (CG-545) should be notified so 
that th e request for information may be forwarded to the Dep artment of State 
(DOS).  This method also facilitates tr acer action if  information is lost in transit. 
The IO may issue subpoenas to obtain the at tendance of witness es or production of 
books, papers, documents , or other relevant evidence need ed by the IO.  Subpoenas 
shall not be issued by IOs when acting solely under 14 USC 89 a uthority.  See 
Chapters A2 and A3 of this volume for further information on various authorities 
under which an IO can iss ue subpoenas. 
C.STEP TWO:FACT FINDING
The objectiv e of the fact finding step of the in vestigation is to collect as man y facts as 
possible which may help in understanding the potential violation and the events 
surrounding it.  IOs should be aware of the danger of reaching conclusions too early, 
thereby failing to keep an open mind and c onsidering the full ra nge of possibilities.  
See Chapter B3 of this volume for more information. 
Proper evidence collectio n and handling are of paramount imp ortance.  See Chapter 
B3 of this vo lume for more information. 
If the preliminary investigation indicates possible S&R action against an MMC, all 
available additional information and evidence should be obtained as quickly as 
possible.  The information contained i n Official Logbooks and Shipping Articles, for 
instance, is considered a minimal resource to be su pplemented with statements from 
prospective witnesses, diagrams, photogra phs, etc.  This supplemental information 
should be obtained even though it may not be used as evidence i n subsequent

D.2.MINIMUM 
CONTENT OF REPORT 
OF APPARENT 
VIOLATIONAt a minimu m, IOs must indicate: 
- Which law or regulation may have been violated; 
- The jurisdictional elements of that la w or regulation; 
- The facts of the case co nstituting evidence of each jurisdictional element; 
- The factual elements of that law or r egulation;  
- The facts of the case wh ich constitute evidence o f each factua l element; an d   actions.  In very serious or complex ca ses, or instances of possible protracted  delay 
before final action, statem ents signed unde r oath should be obtai ned from witnesses.
When first boarding a vessel, the IO should report his or her presence and purpose 
to the mas ter or senior deck officer.  Reasonable efforts should be made to conserve 
the master's time. 
Since most i nvestigations require interviews of crewmembers, the IO should request 
the use of an area where priv acy can be ensured.  This will enable the IO to interview 
personnel privately, with as little distracti on as poss ible.  Witnesses should not be 
interviewed together. 
The IO should, as far as reasonable, stay aboard the vessel until the investigation is 
completed.  This will ordinarily be possible becaus e most "lead s" can usually be 
developed o n the ship.  The IO should strive to complete th e investigation in 
sufficient time to avoid a delay in sail ing. 
D.STEP THREE:IDENTIFY LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN FORCE
IOs should have a working knowledge of the major laws and regulations that the 
Coast Guard enforces.  This ranges from both Titl es 33 and 46 of the U.S. C ode and 
Code of Federal Regulations, as well as Title 18, U.S. Code.  Additionally, a working 
knowledge of the Maritime Law Enforcement M anual, COMDTINST M16247.1 
(series) and the Investigations Manual , COMDTINST M5527.1 (series) will be of 
great benefit.  All laws an d regulations are compos ed of two ba sic sets of elements:  
the jurisdictional elements governing where and to  whom the la w applies; an d the 
factual elements governing the acts or conditions involved.  To determine whether a 
given law or regulation was in force at the time of an incident, the IO must evaluate 
the jurisdictional elements of that law or regulation .  This section will briefly discuss 
the content of report of violation and some of the more comm on offenses that an IO 
might be called upon to i nvestigate.  The last line of each paragraph will explain 
to whom the offense applies (i.e. MMC holders, everyone, or non-MMC 
holders).

33 CFR 95 c onveys the Coast Guard’s stan ce on the use of alcohol in the maritime 
community and established rules to minimize incid ents of individuals operating a 
vessel while intoxicated.  46 CFR 4.05-12 fu rther requires that marine casualty ROIs 
include information on whether or not the use of alcohol contributed to th e casualty.  
Additionally, 46 CFR 16.240 requires drug  and alcohol tests be conducted o n 
individuals involved in serious marine incidents.

D.4.c.  Detection of Intoxication Incidents 
D.4.d.  Operational Controls - The person culpable for the possible violation. 
Any MMCs issued upon submission of false inform ation are void.  See Commandant 
Decision on Appeal 2025.  When a fraudulent application results in the issuance of an 
original MMC, the credential is considered void and may be recovered with out the 
process of an Administrative Hearing.  When a fraudulent application results  in the 
issuance of a MMC renewal, current policy requires an Admini strative Hear ing where 
the proper sanction is revocation.  See Appeal Decisions 2205 &  2569.  Under 18 
USC 1001, intentionally false or fraudulent st atements or rep resentations made in any 
matter withi n the jurisdiction of any department or  agency of th e United States are 
punishable by a $10,000 fine or 5 years' im prisonment, or both.  IOs should consider 
forwarding c ases involvin g false or fraudu lent statements to th e appropriate Area, 
MLC or Dist rict legal office for consideration of referring the case to the loca l U.S. 
Attorney for prosecution.  (MMC holders) 
(everyone) 
33 CFR 95 sets intoxicati on standards based upon blood alcohol concentrati on 
(BAC) levels  and/or observed behavior; defi nes what constitu tes reasonable cause for 
chemical testing of individuals; and estab lishes certain operating rules for co mmercial 
marine personnel serving aboard inspected vessels.
The marine employer is responsible for the detection and reduction of incidents 
involving intoxicated operators aboard  commercial vessels.  OCMIs and COTPs 
should review the eviden ce that marine empl oyers submit of intoxication in a timely 
manner.  If the submitted  evidence is inad equate to  support enforcement action, the 
marine empl oyer should be informed of specific discrepancies discovered so that 
adequate evidence is pres ented in futu re situations. 
The OCMI or COTP has discretion to decide if operational controls should be 
initiated.  Voyages shall be terminated by use of COTP orders or OCMI termination 
letters (coor dinated thro ugh the servicing District office), unless there is ano ther 
operator who is capable and properly licensed to operate th e vessel.  See th e Maritime 
Law Enforcement Manual , COMDTINST M16247.1 (series) and Part C of this 
manual for additional guidance with r egard to enforcement. 
 D.5.FAILURE TO 
OBEYWhenever th e basis of a complaint is refusal or failure to obey a n order, the evidence 
should show: 
- That the order was not i n the nature of a request; 
- That it was properly communicated to  the individual being investigated; 
- That it was lawful; and  
- That it was directly conn ected wi th the safe operations of the vessel. 
D.6.ABSENCE 
OVER LEAVE 
(AOL),ABSENCE 
WITHOUT LEAVE 
(AWOL), AND 
FAILURE TO JOINAn investigation should be conducted to establish that the a bsence of the m ariner 
created a situ ation in which the safety of the vessel, passengers, crew, or marine 
environment was adversel y affected; th e fact that the absence created a crew shortage 
below the co mplement required by the Certificate o f Inspection (COI) usually 
establishes s uch an adver se effect.   
(MMC holder) 
D.7.NEGLIGENCE When condu cting investigations possibly concerning negligence IO's should 
determine whether they can establish the following elements: 
What a “reas onable and p rudent person’s” duty in the same con ditions would have 
been; and 
Whether the error was a clear breach o f that duty. 
Negligent operation of a vessel is generally prohibited under Title 46 U.S.C. 2302(a) 
when such n egligent operation endang ers the lif e, limb, or property of a person.  This 
statute applies only on the U.S. territorial se a, howev er.  Title 46 CFR 5.101(a)(1) and 
table 5.569 suggest that sanctions are appr opriate for acts of negligence by mariners 
holding and acting under the authority of an MMC.  Acts of negligence by non-U.S. 
mariners when outside th e U.S. territorial sea, or when such neg ligence does not
endanger the life, limb, or property of a pe rson should not be considered a violation 
of U.S. law or regulation.  Wake dama ges and navigation interference are g ood 
examples of negligence issues that should be investigated and referred for 
enforcement.  
D.8.OIL

below, the viability of pursuing further enfo rcemen t action shall  be evaluated .  If the 
 D.9.b.  Fatal Flaws In Dangerous Drug Use 
Investigations 
Commandant's Decision on Appeal (CDOA) number 2555 vacated a finding of 
proved for t he use of dangerous drugs because  of a fatal flaw in the chain o f custody 
surrounding the test sp ecimen in question.  In that case, the collector neglected to 
obtain the d onor's signature on the custody and control form.  This flaw went 
undetected through the lab analysis, the Medical Review Officer (MRO) review and 
subsequent Coast Guard preferring o f char ges before the Adm inistrative Law Judge 
(ALJ).  The integrity of the chemical testing progra m relies on the substantial 
compliance with prescribed procedures.  IOs shall conduct a th orough review of all 
the facts of a  case before pursuing enfo rcement a ctions.  Although the check  of a 
specimen's chain of custody is the resp onsibility of the MRO, it is important that IOs 
review supporting material during their inve stigation to ensure that all applicable 
regulations have been co mplied with before initiating enforcement action.  Failure to 
do so could result in wasted time and effo rt for all involved parties.  The most 
significant piece of docu mentation available to the IO in a drug use case is the 
custody and control form.  IOs shall beco me famili ar with the Departmen t of 
Transportation (DOT) regulations, 49 CF R Part 40, and specifically Subpart I 
Problems in Drug Testing, 40.191 – 40.209, to ensure that com plaints are not issued 
when a flaw i n the tes ting procedures has not been corrected.  DOT has listed the 
following “fatal flaws” in 40.199 concerni ng the viability of a specimen for use in 
respect to en forcement:  
Specimen Id entification Number (ID ) on the specimen bottle a nd custody a nd 
control form (CCF) do not match; 
No printed collector's na me and no collector’s signature; 
The specimen bottle seal is broken or s hows evidence of tampering (and a split 
specimen cannot be redesignated, see 49 CFR 40.83(g)); 
D.10.GUIDELINES 
FOR REPORTS OF 
SEXUAL OFFENSES 
AND HARASSMENTD.10.a.  Investigation 
Reports of sexual abuse and harassment should be taken seriously and investigated 
immediately.   Interviewing victims of crimes of a sexual nature requires 
comprehensi ve knowledge of victim/witness rights and the need to ensure that 
victims are not subjected to re-victimization throu gh the investigative process.  46 
USC 1010 4 - Requirement to Report Sexual Offenses, requires a master, or other 
individual in charge, to report complai nts of sexual offenses to the Coast Gu ard.  
Complaints may also be r eceived from the vi ctim, witness, or other law enfo rcement report appea rs to be com plete, the IO  shall notify the marine employer to ensure that 
the mariner is removed from any safety sensitive p osition, and initiate enforcement 
action.  Questions regarding the seriousness of specific flaws and the viability of 
certain evidence for use in the enforcement process should be addressed to the 
Office of Investigations and Casua lty Analysis, Commandant (CG-545). 
Because of leakage or other causes, th ere is  an insufficient amount of urine in the 
primary specimen bottle f or analysis and the speci mens cannot be redesignated, see

 agencies.  18 USCG Chapter 109A - Sexual Abuse, defines the s exual offenses which 
are required to be reported under 46 USCG  10104.  The offen ses described in 
Chapter 109A are: 
Aggravated sexual abuse; 
Sexual abuse; 
Sexual abuse of a minor or ward; and 
Abusive sexual contact.

E.2.c.  Suspension and Revocation (S&R) Proceedings Investigating offenses of a sexual natu re requires specialized tra ining and experience.  
IOs shall immediately for ward to the Coa st Guard Investigative Service via the 
cognizant Di strict Commander all alleged, actual or suspected i ncidents of aggravated 
sexual abuse, sexual abuse, sexual abuse of a minor or ward, and abusive sexual 
contact.  The Coast Guar d Investigative Service, in consultation  with the app ropriate 
servicing legal office, will determine a ppropriate investigative action and noti fication 
of other agencies, including the FBI, as necessary.
46 USC 10104(b) authorizes up to a $ 6500.00 civil penalty again st a master, or other 
individual in charge, who knowingly fa ils to report a complaint of sexual abuse to the 
Coast Guard.  The Investigating Officer (IO) shall process an Administrative Class 1 
Civil Penalty against the master, or other in dividua l in charge, if the investigation 
finds that th e master, or other individual in charge knew of the incident, and  the 
complaint was made to the Coast Gu ard by the victim, witness es, or other law 
enforcement agency. 
E.STEP FOUR:REVIEW THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
To establish jurisdiction over a person or organization, the IO must accurately 
identify who was involved (generally, this is not an issue).  Further, for any 
subsequent enforcement action to be effecti ve con tact information for that person 
must be com plete and a ccurate. 
MMCs are any License, Certificate of Regist ry (COR), Merchant Mariner Document 
(MMD) or STCW Certificate issued by th e Coast Guard authorizing service  on 
vessels, as required by vario us statutes and regulations. 
An MMC holder is a mariner who has been  issued any MMC by the Coast Guard. 
S&R proceedings are proceedings agains t MMCs under the authority of 46 USC 
Chapter 77.  See Part C of this volume for additional information. 
 E.2.d.  Non-MMC Holder 
E.3.PROOF OF 
PERSON INVOLVEDEvidence of the individual’s role as owner, operator, or other persons working 
aboard the v essel is extremely important.  It is important to ha ve evidence i n the file 
as to who th e actual own er/operator and other persons working aboard the vessel 
were at th e time of the violation.   Exampl es of proof of identify can include but are 
not limited to: 
- Copy of vessel’s documentation/Cer tificate of Inspection (if applicable); 
- Copies of vessel’s log entries/ship’s papers; 
- Copies of a person’s MMC (if required for the job they were performing);  
- Company work schedules; or

INVESTIGATING Generally these mariners are deckhands or some other position aboard a ves sel that is

The vessel’s manning requirements determine whether the positi on is required to be 
on the vessel .
- A witness’ statem ent as to the role of the individuals on board. 
The first element must al ways be pres ent to take enforcement action agains t an 
MMC, while the second element is not.   Always es tablish these jurisdictional elements 
early in the i nvestigation.  Additional guidance on jurisdiction over MMC holders and 
when a mari ner is considered acting under the authority of a MMC can be found in 
Chapter C4 of this manual. 
A mariner hired to serve on a public vessel on the condition that he or she holds an 
MMC is subject to S&R p roceedings and thus are subject to per sonnel investigations 
for their actions.  As defined in 46 USC 2101; a ve ssel that is owned, or demise 
chartered, an d operated b y the United States Gover nment or a government o f a 
foreign country; and is not engaged in commercial s ervice.  A public vessel of the 
United States is not subject to Coas t Guard inspection, and is exempt from certain 
other navigation and vessel inspection  requirements (except ves sels owned, operated, 
or controlled by the Department of Tran sportation  (DOT), as p er 46 USC 2109.  
However, th e Command ant has signed an Inspecti on and Certi fication Agreement 
with the Commander, Military Sealift Command  (MSC), and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (ACOE) concerning disciplinary actions against merchant mariner s serving 
on board MSC and ACOE vessels.  IOs shall conduct personnel investigations into 
the actions o f a civil service or contract crewmemb er when poss ession of an MMC is 
a condition of employment.

MANAGEMENT 
DISPUTES
F.1.
INTRODUCTION
F.2.HUMAN ERROR Human error encompasses decisions and actions.  In some insta nces, the a ction the pilot's federal license, although it is re quired by the state bef ore it will issue the 
state license.  See Soriano v. U.S ., 494 F. 2d  681 (9th Cir. 1974).  The U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern Di strict of Louisian a decided that former 46 USC 214 does 
not, by itself, authorize en forcement pro ceedings against federal licenses held by 
pilots acting under authority of state licen ses.  See Dietze v. Siler, 414 F. Sup p. 1105, 
(E.D. LA., 1976).  The Commandant's policy is to follow the Soriano and Dietze 
decisions in cases involving pilots acting under the authority of state co mmis sions.  
However, th e offenses listed in 46 USC 7703(2)-(5) and 7704 are holder offenses and 
S&R action may be initia ted on the federal pilot’s license for state pilots who  are 
required to hold a federal license.  Because of the complex natu re of state pilot 
investigations CG-545 should be contacted  before any S&R acti on is taken regarding 
a federal pilot license.  This policy does not affect investigative procedures 
concerning casualties and civil violatio ns involving state pilots.  Pilots acting under 
authority of federal licenses are subject to investigation and enforcement a ction under 
46 USC Chapter 77, as well as civil or crim inal enforcement a ction.  Pilots acting 
solely under the authority of a state license are subj ect to civil penalty a ction  for 
violation of applicable statu tes.  Any evidence of criminal violation of federal statutes 
shall be referred to the servicing legal office for a determination  as to wheth er to refer 
the case to the local U.S. attorney.  If a viol ation is within the j urisdiction of a state or 
locality, the evidence should be referred to the cog nizant sta te or district attorney.  
See also Co mmandant's Decision on Review 17 (POWER). 
IOs should not become involved in labor/management conflicts.  If a preliminary 
investigation reveals that a contractu al infraction did not affect the safety of the 
passengers, crew, vessel, marine environmen t, or national security, no further action 
should be taken.  This policy requires OCMIs and their department heads to 
remember th at IOs should not place themselves in roles as labor/management 
arbitrators.  See 46 CFR 5.71; Appeal Deci sion 2470 (Giachetti).  See Chapter A3 for 
specific information. 
F.STEP FIVE:CONSIDER HUMAN ERROR
Human error is a predictable part of th e Marine Transportation System.  When 
performing violation analysis, the IO must be alert to human er ror as:  1) an act 
expressly prohibited in a law or regulation; and 2) an act of professional 
incompeten ce, misconduct, or negligence.  The term “human error” applies to a wide 
variety of human behavio rs, as described in Chapter B4 of this volume.  Skill-based 
errors, for instance, are si gnificantly diffe rent from knowledge-based errors.  In 
general, when considering whether a human error may be consi dered a violation 
(including negligence), the IO should use  the following rule:  unless the actio n 
violated a specific law or an error was made in good faith based on mistaken
judgment or misanalysis of an “unsettled” area (i.e., knowledge-based performance), 
the action or  error does not usually rise to the level  of negligenc e or misconduct. 
 AS DIRECT 
VIOLATION OF LAW 
OR REGULATIONperformed in error (unintended or willful) will be directly prohibited by law or 
regulation.  In such cases,  regardless of intent, the error should be treated as a 
violation of that regulation or law.  The intent of th e person involved, however, is 
relevant in assessing the appropriate level of  enforcement.  See Chapter B6 of this 
volume for specific detail s concerning various violations of law or regulation. 
G.1.GENERAL
H.1.GENERAL
H.2.TYPE AND 
QUALITY OF 
EVIDENCEThe type a nd quality of evidence is critical to the vio lation analysi s.  No matter how 
thoroughly a facility inspection, vessel boarding, or pollution investigation wa s 
conducted, a violation will not be found to exist if the evidentiar y package is not 
collected and  submitted to the hearing officer.  Keep in mind, a violation cannot be 
said to have occurred unless there is s ufficient competent evidence to estab lish every 
element of the alleged violation.  See Chapter B6 of this volume for specific details 
concerning evidence for each element.
I.1.GENERALG.STEP SIX:CONSIDER OMISSIONS
In performing violation analysis, the Investig ating Officer (IO) must also be alert for 
specific actio ns which a mariner or other person:  1) was explicitly required to 
perform by law or regulation, but which they failed to perform; or 2) was required by 
standards of professional competence,  form alized (non-regulatory) rule, or accepted 
standards of attention to duty, but whi ch they failed to perform.  In these ca ses, the 
failure  to tak e an action or make a judgment may be considered a violation, just as 
taking an acti on would.  See Chapter B6 of this volume for specific details concerning 
omissions. 
H.STEP SEVEN:CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH ELEMENT
Because no two cases are factually the same , it is impossible to provide a cookbook 
listing of the evidence that needs to be ga thered in each incident to support a prima 
facie case.  In general, the government must present sufficient competent  evidence 
establishing every elemen t of an alleged vi olation before a violation can be found to 
have occurred.  Therefore, in analyzing vi olations, IOs must be aware of what types 
of evidence would best establish each element of a violation.
I.STEP EIGHT:REPORT APPARENT VIOLATIONS
Once anal ysis is complete, apparent violations should be referred for enforcement 
evaluation and appropriate action.  The report SHOULD NOT CONCLUDE that a 
violation did or did not  occur.  Instead, having met the thresh olds for evidence 
suggested above, the IO should report only that th ere is evidence of the specific

J.1.INTERACTION 
WITH MARINE BOARDS 
OF INVESTIGATIONJ.1.a.  General Principles 
The OCMI of the port in which a Marine Board of Investigation is held shall conduct 
a personnel investigation as soon as sufficient information indicates a possibl e 
violation of law or regulation by a person under Coast Guard jurisdiction.  This 
information may be obtai ned during a preliminary casualty inves tigation or from 
evidence received by the Marine Board.  The IO or the IO's representative should 
arrange to attend those s essions that the IO deems  appropriate.  Under no 
circumstances should a personnel investig ation resulting from a marine casualty 
interfere with the work o f the Marine Board.  Liaison between the IO and th e Marine 
Board recorder will provide a smooth flow of  information that will be helpful to the 
IO, and possibly the Marine Board.  The following actions might be consider ed:  
Advise the r ecorder of any personnel  investigation being contemplated; and  
J.1.b.  Simultaneous Activities apparent violation warran ting further enforcement evaluation. 
All personnel investigations shall be documented i n the MISLE computer system in 
accordance with applica ble CG-545 data en try policy, and the MISLE Investigations 
and Enforcement Process Guides.  As a matter of policy, IO's will document all
reports of apparent violation in MISLE in  the relevant detectio n activity.  Direct 
entry of enforcement a ctivities without r ecord of the underlying investigation is 
expressly prohibited.   
Where a written ROI is prepared, the IO  shall include only statements of th e 
following for m: “During t he course of this  investigation, sufficient evidence of an 
apparent violation of 46 CFR X.XX wa s discovered to warrant referral for 
enforcement evaluation.  Final evaluation and agency action on this evidence will be 
reported sep arately.”   
IOs shall not include statements to th e effect of “there is no evidence of negligence” 
and so on.  In general the absence of a report of apparent violation in MISLE or the 
ROI speaks for itself.  Where the IO is forced to directly ans wer such questio ns, a 
note to th e effect of “insufficient eviden ce of negligence was av ailable/enco untered 
to warrant referral for enforcement ev aluation,” should be mad e in the ROI.
J.OTHER INVESTIGATIVE ISSUES
Request per mission to interview witn esses after the Marine Board has questioned 
them. 
Personnel investigations should be conducted after a Marine Board has con vened 
only with the approval of the Marine Boar d Chairperson.  If the Chairperson requests 
an abeyan ce until the Marine Board adjourns, investigative activities should be 
suspended.  This is often requested so that the Marine Board has flexibility in 
developing recommend ations for submittal to  the Commandan t.  However, this does 
not preclude initiation of enforcement proceedings during the course of, or

JUSTICE (DOJ) 
K.1.SUSPENDED 
CASESimmediately following, the Marine Board’s inve stigation.  If sufficient information in 
the personnel investigation is developed before the casualty investigation is 
completed, enforcement action may b e initiated .  Prior to taking enforcemen t action, 
however, the Marine Board Chairperson should be notified and the Chairper son's 
recommenda tions respected. 
If, upon review of the M arine Board’s ROI the Co mmandant d irects further 
personnel investigation, the IO shall obtain the initial information by the most 
expeditious means possi ble.   
On many occasions, information recei ved du ring a Coast Guard  investigation may be 
of importance to other federal, state, o r local law en forcement a uthorities.  These 
authorities should be notified at the earliest  opportunity, to enable them to take early 
investigative action, if warranted.  
During the initial phase of an investigati on, it may become ap parent that necessary 
information is available outside the jurisdiction of the local OC MI.  Generally, such 
information can be obtained by the OCMI with the appropriate area of responsibility 
(AOR) and forwarded to the IO cond ucting the investigation.  However, if it is 
determined that all of the information needed is lo cated in ano ther AOR an d that 
anticipated Coast Guard action will be ta ken there, the investigation may be 
transferred to that OCMI . 
When a personnel investigation reveals evidence of criminal liability, the IO should 
discuss the merits of the case with thei r servicing District Legal Office (dl) and 
possibly the local Coast G uard Investigative Service (CGIS) speci al agent for possible 
referral to the local U.S. Attorney for appr opriate a ction.  If the evidence indicates 
criminal liability within th e jurisdiction of a st ate or locality, it should be forwarded to 
the District Commander with a recom mendation f or referral to the appropriate 
prosecutor.  
K.INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
When a mari ner under investigation cannot be located, the IO should complete the 
case as fully as possible and place the mariner on the Wanted L ist in MISLE for the 
purpose of an investigation.  No Incident In vestigation activity shall be transferred to 
CG-545 with  a mariner still on the Wanted List  for the purpose of an investigation.  
The investigation shall remain open until the mariner is located or there is no possible 
enforcement action tha t can be taken a gainst the m ariner, i.e. the 1 year grace period 
on the MMC has passed, or the statute of limitations for an offe nse under 46 USC 
Chapter 77 has expired.  When the mariner under investigation cannot be located but 
evidence gathered indicates that S&R a ction under 46 USC Chapter 77 is warranted, 
the IO should complete a  referral for enfor cement creating an Enforcemen t Activity.  
The IO should develop the case in th e Enforcemen t Activity as fully as possible and

The activity shall include all the evidence collect ed, i.e., (but is not limited to) Official 
Logbook entries, abstracts of Shipping Arti cles, statements of witnesses, and their 
names, addresses, and telephone numbers.  See also: Chapter C4 on locking mariner’s 
record. 
OCMI's may submit letters or other types of reports commendi ng merchant mariners 
and officers to the Director, National Maritime Center (NMC4A).  NMC4A 
encourages such submittals.  All marine safety pers onnel should recognize instances 
of outstanding performa nce of duty by mariners and make suitable reports to 
NMC4A.  They may also request information as to the prior record of a mariner for 
the completion and forwarding of suc h reports. 
Close liaison between field offices and CG-545 is desirable.  Officers assigned to CG-
545 have the advantage o f being exposed to a wide variety of ca ses and situa tions.  In 
addition, they will be aware of the latest policy concerning vario us matters as  well as 
non-criminal search tools and methods .IOs are encouraged to telephone CG-545 
when necess ary to discus s problems of mutual concern.

B.2.a.  Documentation A.ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE AND SCOPE
The guidance provided by this Part of this Volume modifies and replaces po licy 
previously located in Vol ume I of the Marine Safety Manual.  This policy signals a 
strong Coast Guard natio nal law enforcement p osture and requires the initiation of 
appropriate enforcement actions tha t serve to  minimize the risk  to people, p roperty, 
and the mari ne environment.  For all situations wh ere prima facie evidence o f a 
violation exists, administrative, judicial, and/or criminal enforcement a ction s should 
be initiated, regardless of how the violati on is discovered (i.e., through a port safety 
boarding, a marine inspection, a marine invest igation, or other activity).  For instances 
involving civil violations, enforcement acti ons shou ld range from issuance o f a Letter 
of Warning for a minor, first time violation which i s immediatel y corrected, to the 
initiation of civil violatio n cases. 
This chapter provides an overview of mari ne safety and environmental protection law 
enforcement.  It defines enforcement from a system’s perspecti ve and establ ishes 
overall enforcement principles.  Furthermore, this chapter categorizes enforcement 
options and provides policy thresholds  for initiating various enforcement op tions.  
This chapter should be consulted after the completion  of an investigation, 
compliance activity, or other marine safety detecti on activities in accordance with B.3. 
below.
B.ENFORCEMENT OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
Law enforcement is the n ext logical step beyond educational ef forts and regulatory 
controls imposed to minimize mariti me risks. 
Marine safety law enforcement suppo rts the overall goals of the Marine Safety 
Program to promote the safety of life an d property at sea and p rotect th e marine 
environment.  Marine safety law enfor cement actio ns are intend ed to correct 
deficiencies, deter future noncomplian ce, an d minimize risks to persons, property, or 
the marine environment.   
Enforcemen t actions sho uld be formally documented and com municated b oth 
externally (i.e., deficiency or violation notif ications, letters, incident reports, etc.) to 
the involved parties and internally within the Coas t Guard (i.e., messages, MISLE 
reports, etc.) as required.  Meeting enfor cement ob jectives depends in large part on 
informed targeting and prioritization of acti vities.  This, in turn, is dependent upon 
proper documentation of  enforcemen t actions within the Marine Information for 
Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) system an d access a t all levels of the Coast 
Guard organization. 
 
 enforcement action(s) n ecessary to: 
•Assure timel y compliance; 
•Guarantee th at penalties a re not cons idered a cost o f doing business; 
•Effectively deter future violation by th e party and b y the public at large; and 
B.3.c.  Selecting the Appropriate Enforcement Action(s) 
Marine safety personnel, units, district and area co mmanders must evaluate the 
following in determining which enforcemen t action s are applica ble and appropriate: 
•Jurisdiction to impose a particular sanction; 
•The nature o f the offense; 
•The seriousness of the offense; 
•The deterren t effect of en forcement action on the i ndividuals involved; 
•The deterren t effect of en forcement o n the general  public; 
•The Coast G uard’s relative ranking of enforcement actions; and

CONSEQUENCE 
RECOMMENDATION
C.2.COMPLIANCE 
REQUIREMENTS•Assure that penalties for a given viol ation in similar circumstances are 
consistent na tionwide. 
•Competing compliance, investigation, and law enf orcement wo rkload. 
C.RELATIVE RANKING OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS
No-consequence recommendations are non-binding recommendations, verbal 
advisories, and examinati on result reports pr ovided to a person or organization as a 
courtesy for safety or environmental p rotection pur poses and which are not related to 
regulations or laws binding at the time of  the Coast Guard law enforcement activities, 
typically passenger vessel, commercial fishin g vessel or towing vessel examinations.  
Such recom mendations are not consi dered part of the relevant safety/enforcement 
record for use in future Coast Guard a ctivities.  See Chapter C2 of this volume and 
volume II of this manual for more information. 
Compliance requirements are instructions to correct apparent d eficiencies/violations 
of a minor nature and pr ovide proof of th at correction to the Coast Guard  before a 
specific date (e.g. CG-835).  Upon receiving  timely and satisfactory evidence of 
correction, the Coast Gu ard will not to treat th e underlying offense(s) as a violation.  
If timely and satisfactory evidence of correction is not corrected, the Coast Guard 
may proceed  with further enforcemen t action as n ecessary to as sure compliance and 
deterrence.  In all cases, the compliance re quirement will be considered part of the 
relevant safety record for use in future Coast Guar d activities a nd shall be 
documented as a stay for compliance enfor cement activity in Marine Information for 
Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE).  See volume II of this manual for more

Warnings are formal, written notices of  an apparent violation for which no m onetary 
or other sanction is appropriate.  In all case s, the warning will b e considered part of 
the relevant safety record  for use in future Coast G uard activities.  See Chapter C2 of 
this volume for further information .
Referral for Other Agency Enforcement is the forwarding of all relevant evidence 
and facts surrounding a specific offense to anoth er agency with enforcement 
jurisdiction over the responsible party and th e offense.  Such referrals are considered 
part of the relevant safety record for us e in future boardings, inspections, exa ms, 
inspections, and so on.  Upon conclusive report from the affected agency that the 
referral was justified, the Coast Guard will treat the underlying offense(s) as proven 
violations for the purposes of selecti ng the appropriate enforcement action and 
penalty in future Coast G uard activities. 
A Notice of Violation (N OV) is a formal, wr itten notice of an apparent violation for 
which a pred etermined m onetary pen alty is appropriate.  In all cases, the pro secution 
will be considered part of the relevant sa fety record  for use in future Coast Guard 
activities.  See COMDTINST M5582.1 (serie s), NOV User’s Guide, and Chapter C3 
of this volu me for furth er information. 
The Class I Administrati ve Civil Pena lty process is used when the issuance of a 
warning or NOV is not appropriate.  Thes e cases are adjudicated by Coast Guard 
Hearing Officers.  In all cases, the prosecuti on will be considered part of the relevant 
safety record  for use in future Coast G uard a ctivities.  See Chapter C3 of this volume 
for fu rther information. 
A Suspension and Revocation proceeding is the presentation of  all relevant evidence 
and facts surrounding a specific offense committed by a mariner who holds and/or is 
acting under the authority of a Coast Guard issued merchant mariner credential to a 
Coast Guard  Administrati ve Law Judge for adjudication and appropriate sanction.  In 
all cases, the prosecution will be considered part of the relevant safety record  for use 
in future Coast Guard activities.  See Chapter C4 of this volume for further 
information. 
The Class II Administrati ve Civil Pena lty process is used only for certain violations of 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) 
and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA).  It may be pu rsued in egregious and willful violations of these sta tutes 
where the m aximum penalty associated with a Clas s I Administrative Civil Penalty is 
deemed insu fficient, or in cases where the Coast G uard desires to require the 
responsible party to create a compliance pr ogram.  Class II Administrative Civil 
Penalty asses sments may be made onl y by Admini strative Law Judges using the 
procedures contained in 33 CFR Part 20.  In all cases, the prosecution will be

OPERATIONAL 
CONTROLSOperational controls are the direct ass umption of physical control over a person, 
vessel, facility, or waterway in order to en d potentially unsafe or illegal operations.  
Operational controls include detentio ns, voyage terminations, COTP, and District 
Commander orders, and administrative orde rs under the FWPCA among others.  In 
all cases, however, operational controls will be  considered a part of the relevant safety 
record for use in future Coast Guard a ctivities.  See volume II of this manual and/or, 
COMDTINST M16247.1 (series), Maritime Law Enforcemen t Manual, for further 
information.  Due to the f act that oper ational contr ols can be very minor or 
extremely ser ious, it was placed at the end of the enforcement rel ative ranking. considered part of the relevant safety record  for use in future Coast Guard a ctivities.  
See Chapter C3 of this volume for furt her information. 
Certificate or Permit Revocation is th e restriction of a vessel’s operation by 
modification or removal of Coast Guard issued documents such that an apparent 
violation ceases to exist.  Certificate or Permit Revocation usual ly accompanies other 
enforcement action, and has no bearing on wheth er the Coast Guard views the 
underlying offense(s) as proven.  In all cases, however, certificate or permit 
revocation will be considered part of the rele vant s afety record for use in fut ure Coast 
Guard activities.  Due to the fact tha t certificate or permit revocation may or  may not 
be considered extremely s erious, it was placed towa rd the end of the enforcement 
relative ranking.  See volu me II of this manual for further information. 
The Judicial Civil Penalty process is the pres entatio n of all relevant evidence and facts 
surrounding a specific offense to Federal District Court Judge for adjudication.  A 
Judicial Civil Penalty may be pursued for a wide variety of violations, but is usually 
reserved for egregious an d willful vio lations where the maximum penalties associated 
with a Class I Administrative Civil Penalty is deem ed insufficient to meet 
enforcement goals.  In all cases, the pr osecution wil l be considered part of th e 
relevant safety record for use in future Coast  Guar d activities.  See Chapter C3 of this 
volume for further information. 
Referral for Criminal Enforcement is the presenta tion of all relevant facts an d 
evidence surrounding a specific criminal offense to the U.S. Department of  Justice 
for evaluation.  Area, Maintenance & Lo gistics Command, and District Commanders 
are authorized to refer cases to the U.S. attorney.  Commandant CG-545 approval is 
required before referral to the U.S. attorn ey for the following cases where evi dence of 
a criminal offense is disclosed: marine ca sualties or  accidents that result in death, 
marine boards, and violations of port security regulations.  In all cases, referral for 
criminal enforcement wil l be considered part of th e relevant safety record fo r use in 
future Coast Guard activities.

D.ENFORCEMENT POLICY
In general, taking one enforcement a ction related to a specific offense does not 
preclude the Coast Guard  from taking othe r simulta neous enforcement a ction .  In 
significant or severe cases,  multiple avenues of enforcement action will be both 
necessary an d desirable in view of the general enforcement stan ce.  The only two 
significant exceptions are those enforcemen t action s that derive from the Coast 
Guard’s administrative civil penalty au thorities (i.e. marine sa fety personnel may not 
simultaneously initiate Warnings, Notic es of Violation, Class I Administrative Civil 
Penalties, and Class II Administrative Civ il Penalties) and those enforcemen t actions 
that derive from the Coast Guard’s suspensi on and revocation authorities (i.e. marine 
safety person nel may not simultaneous ly initiate a Warning and the issuance of a 
Complaint to the same i ndividual for the same offense).  
Some statutes set forth factors that m ust be consid ered by the Coast Guard  Hearing 
Officer when a civil penalty is assessed.  Some of these factors have been lis ted 
below.  In recommending a penalty, marine safety personnel may consider the 
information below in con junction with the recom mended pen alty levels co ntained in 
the enclosur es to COMD TINST 16200.3 (series), Civil Penalty Procedures and 
Administrati on, to deter mine an appr opriate reco mmended penalty.  NOT E: Penalty 
Factors were taken from ALCOAST 176/93, 137/95, 149/95, and G-MO message 
P251 943Z Feb 97.   
Consider the degree to which the offender is  believed to have benefited economically 
from violating federal law or regulation.  At a mini mum, penalti es should exceed any 
economic benefit of viola tion.  In some cases, the economic benefit gained by the 
offender may be added to the penalty recommend ation. 
See D.3. below to determine the rela tive ranking of the specific offense in terms of 
recommended penalties. 
Consider the duration of the offense in days.  Also consider the total number of 
 D.2.e.  The Gravity of the Prohibited Acts 
D.2.f.  The Degree of Culpability/Responsibility  
D.2.g.  The Violation History of the Offender 
•Prior Similar Offenses .  Prior proven violations  of the specific law or 
regulation in question during the previous 12 months must be explicitly 
considered. 
•Prior Offenses of Any Type .  For more serious (Ca tegory C and  D) 
violations, consider the entire violati on history of the person or organization 
for the past 5 year period.   
D.2.h.  The Degree of Cooperation 
Consider the degree of success of the offender ’s efforts to minimize or miti gate the 
effects of the offense (particularly spills).  Evaluate and classify using the following 
categories: prompt and s uccessful response; adequ ate response;  inadequate r esponse; 
poor or no response.   
D.2.i.  Warnings for Oil Discharge Offenses  
Where there is no history of repeat violati ons or major deficiencies, the Captain of 
the Port (C OTP) is authorized the di scretion to is sue a written  warning for the 
following oil discharge offenses: 
•All Category A (non-commercial sour ce) discharges of oil where the 
discharged amount is less than fifty (50) U.S. gallons; 
•All Category B (commerci al source) discharges where the quanti ty of oil 
spilled is less  than twenty-five (25) gallons. deficiencies and apparent violations en countered while condu cting the detection 
activity.  When seeking higher penalties on this basis, itemize the recommend ed 
penalty for each discrepa ncy and articulate the rati onale used. 
Consider the impact or threat to heal th, welfare, the environment, or property.  
Consider incident specifics such as resulting deaths and injuries, threat or impact to 
such things as response personnel safety, government response resources exp ended, 
drinking water, recreation facilities, ecosystems, wil dlife, marina s, etc.  For spills, 
consider the volume of oil or hazardous substance discharged/released, using the 
spill size categories define d in the Na tional Contingency Plan at 40 CFR 300.6. 
Consider the degree to which the pers on or organization is culpable for the offense.  
Specifically, an increasing range of culpability is: none, inattenti on, neglect, gross 
neglect, and intentional violation.  The enforcemen t action selected and pen alty 
amount shou ld be more severe in insta nces of inattention, neglect, gross neglect, or 
intentional a cts.

AN APPROPRIATE 
ENFORCEMENT OPTIONNot all of these options a re appropriate in ev ery instance.  In general, marine safety 
personnel shall evaluate the least severe action and  proceed toward more severe 
actions as necessary.  While on-scene, qua lified marine safety personnel must evaluate 
and select from the following available on-scene enforcement actions for each 
apparent violation detected.  The following are listed in increasing order of severity: 
•Refer for Fu rther Investigation (see Part B of this volume);  
•No-consequence Recom mendation (s ee Chapter C2 of this volume); 
•Compliance Requirement (see volume II); 
•Letter of Warning (see Chapter C2 of this volume); 
•Notice of Vi olation (see Chap ter C3 of this volume); When other penalties hav e been imposed fo r the same offense by state or lo cal 
governments, the Coast Guard may give cons ideration to dedu cting some portion of 
those amoun ts form the penalty reco mmended. 
Consider adjusting the penalty up or down based on any other r elevant factors not 
specified above which justice may requi re. 
Category A Offenses are those extremel y low impact offenses  committed by non-
commercial entities such as recreation al boaters or small-entity commercial entities 
where there are no significant issues of culpability.   
Category B Offenses are those low conse quence offenses committed by s mall entity 
commercial people or organizations wher e there are no significant issues of 
culpability but immediate correction is necessa ry in the interest of safety of life, 
property, or the environment.   
Category C Offenses are those grave offe nses committed by any commerci al or non-
commercial person or organization where there are significant issues of culpability.  . 
Category D Offenses are those especially gr ave or criminal offenses committed by 
any commercial or non-commercial pers on or organization where there are 
significant issues of culpability that clea rly warrant a substantial penalty.

F.1.REVIEW OF 
ON-SCENE 
ENFORCEMENT 
DECISIONSThe Sector Commander / Commandi ng Officer shall review each enforcement 
action taken or recommended under his or her authority.  Such review is normally 
delegated to senior department heads, though the Sector Comm ander / Com manding 
Officer should retain personal review of the most s erious enforcement a ction s.  
Based upon that review, the Sector Co mmander / Commandin g Officer ma y: 
•Initiate Unit Enforcement Actions .  When the S ector Comm ander / 
Commandin g Officer determines that unit-level enforcement a ction is 
appropriate, he or she ma y initiate a new enforcement action.  Many of the 
more serious enforcemen t actions can not be initiated by marine safety 
personnel while on-scene.  They will typically refer these instances along with 
a recommen ded course o f unit action.  In these cas es where review of the 
evidence war rants it, the S ector Comm ander / Com manding Officer shall 
initiate the a ppropriate enforcement action.  
•Return the Enforcement Action to  the on-scene marine safety 
personnel for further docume ntation or invest igation.   When the Sector 
Commander / Commandi ng Officer determines th at insufficient 
documenta tion or evidence exists to warrant the r ecommend ed enforcement 
action, he or she may retu rn the activi ty to the appropriate field personnel for 
further documentation or  investigation.  Where enforcement action has 
already taken  place, that a ction must  be withdrawn pending completion of 
adequate inv estigation or documentation. 
•Withdraw and close the  Enforcement Action.  When the Sector 
Commander / Commandi ng Officer determines th at the do cumentation or 
evidence pro vided does not meet the r equired jurisdictional and  factual 
elements of the discrepan cy or violation, he or she may withdra w the 
enforcement action pendi ng further inve stigation, or close the enforcement 
action.  When an enforcement action is withdrawn and closed, the Sector 
Commander / Commandi ng Officer shall assure that the marine safety 
personnel that initiated the enforcemen t action are advised of his or her 
decision. 
•Upgrade or Downgrade  to a more appropriate enforcement action.  
When the Sector Comma nder / Commanding Officer determin es that m arine 
safety person nel selected a n inappropriate enforcem ent action gi ven the 
situation, he or she may u pgrade or downgrade to a  more appropriate 
enforcement action.  When an enforcement a ction  is upgraded or •Forward to unit for Future Enforcement Action.

G.1.REVIEW OF 
UNIT ENFORCEMENT 
DECISIONSThe District Commander shall review each enforcement action referred for his/her 
action.  Based upon that r eview, the District Commander may: 
•Return the Enforcement Activity to  the Unit for further Documentati on 
or Investigation.   When the District Commander determines that 
insufficient documenta tion or evidence exists to warrant the recommended 
enforcement action, he or  she may return the activi ty to th e app ropriate unit 
for fu rther documentatio n or investigation.  •Forward to the Appropr iate Unit.   When the Sector Commander / 
Commanding Officer determines that he or she lacks the author ity or ability 
to take th e appropriate enforcement acti on (as for  Judicial Prosecution), he or 
she may forward evidence of the appa rent violation(s) to ano ther unit 
through the chain of com mand. 
•Impose/Req uest Operati onal Controls (see volume II). 
Where the C oast Guard d etects violati ons or deficiencies over which other agencies 
have sole enforcement jur isdiction, marine safety p ersonnel shall refer such violations 
to the cognizant federal, state, or loca l law enforcement agency via the cognizant 
District Commander.

to a more a ppropriate Enforcement Action.  When the Di strict 
Commander determines that the forwar ding unit selected an inappropriate 
enforcement action given the situation , he or she may return the enforcemen t 
activity to th e appropriate unit to upgrade or downgrade to a more 
appropriate enforcement action.  Decisions of the District Com mander may 
be appealed to the Office of Investigations and Ana lysis, Commandant (CG-
545) by the Sector Comm ander / Com manding Officer. 
•Prosecute or Forward the Enforce ment Activi ty to the Appropriate 
Prosecuting Entity.   When the Distri ct Command er determines that the 
forwarding unit provided a complete  enforcement package, the District 
Commander shall prosecute or forward the enforcement a ctivity to the 
appropriate prosecuting entity (i.e. H earing Officer, U.S. Attorney, etc.) 
G.2.ACTION ON 
UNIT ENFORCEMENT 
REFERRALS
H.1.GENERAL The Office of Investigatio ns and Analysis, Commandant CG-545 shall: 
•Provide Commandant a pproval before referral to the U.S. atto rney for any 
case where evidence of a criminal offens e is disclosed and the case involves 
marine casualties or accidents that re sult in death, marine boards, and 
violations of port security regulations.  
•Coordinate with and obtain TJAG (CG- 094) approval before referring a 
criminal case to the U.S. attorney th at involves a potential charg e under 18 
U.S.C 1115, commonly r efereed to as  the Seaman’ s Manslaughter statute.

the enforcement action the appropr iate District Commander (s) shall 
coordinate al l enforcemen t efforts including the forwarding of evidence of 
the apparent violation(s) to another unit through the chain of co mmand.  
When multiple Districts are involved the Office of Investigations and 
Analysis, Commandant (CG-545) shall be notified via the chai n of command. 
The District Commander,  in determining his or her course of action on referrals, may 
evaluate th e same factors outlined in D.2. above.  If the recom mended enf orcement 
option is applicable and appropriate, the District Commander s hould prosecute or 
forward the case as appr opriate.

COORDINATIONI.1.a.  U. S. Government Agencies 
I.1.a.1.  Customs Service Holds On Vessels  
Under the au thority of 46 U.S.C. 91, vessels intending to depart the United S tates for 
a foreign port must obtai n a clearance from the U. S. Customs Service.  The Customs 
Service under 19 CFR 4.61 and applicable U. S. law, will normally withhold or deny 
clearance based upon a request from the Coast Gu ard in order to ensure vessel 
compliance with shipping laws and interna tional conventions.  Normally, the U. S. 
Customs Service will exercise its authority to hold vessels upon request in order to:  
•Obtain com pliance of specific laws an d implementing regulations through the 
exercise of the following specific citati ons authorizing detention  or denial of 
clearance:  
•U.S. vessel d ocumentation requirement s (46 U.S.C.A. 12102) under 19 CFR 
4.61(b)(3);  
•Applicable load line requirements (46 U.S.C.A. 5113(b) under 19 CFR 4.65a; 
•Certificate of Inspection or Control Ve rification requirements (46 U.S.C.A.

I.1.a.2.  Department Of Justice Assistance  
All interactio ns with the Departmen t of Just ice shall be approved in advance by the 
Area, Maintenance & Logistics Comm and, and District Comma nder.  The following 
are a few areas in which they can assis t with enforcement: 
•Request the U. S. Attorney to prosecute criminal violations.  Use of statutes 
or regulation s providing for criminal penalties against individuals  may be 
initiated when appropriate, regardless of whether o r not the individuals 
involved hold a Coast Guard merchant mariner credential.  The requesting 
unit should forward possible criminal violation cases to the cognizant Distri ct 
legal office for review and possible referral to the U.S. attorney for action.  
Examples include reckless and negligen t operation of a vessel, intoxication 
while operati ng a vessel, intentional di scharges, and failure to notify in 
pollution incidents or marine casualties. 
I.1.b.  State Governments Note: Customs clearance withholding is not a general enforcement tool.  Refer to 
your District legal office for further guidance. 
Request a temporary restraining order (TRO) or injunction from Federal Court to 
prohibit a person from carrying out a specific act, the violation of which results in 
arrest.  Federal court actio n should only be sought when all direct enforcement 
actions have proven insufficient to prohibit individuals from initiating or continuing 
high risk ope rations.  For example, a T RO or injunction might be sought when a 
vessel subject to inspectio n continues to operate without a Certificate of Inspection, 
despite notification of the inspection require ments and a directi on to ceas e operations

initiating any such request.

 A.WARNINGS
A.1.GENERAL Warnings are an enforcem ent action in the form of a formal, written notice of an 
apparent violation, which no monetary or other sanction is appropriate, with 
consequences for its refusal.   Such warnings may be accep ted o r declined by the 
receiving individual.  When accep ted, the Coast Gu ard treats the underlying 
offense(s) as proven violations for th e purposes of selecting an appropriate 
enforcement action and p enalty for future enforcement actions .  When declined, the 
Coast Guard  will proceed with further enforcement action as necessary to as sure 
compliance and deterrence as detailed below.  In all cases, the warning will b e
considered part of the relevant safety record  for use in future Coast Guard a ctivities.  
A.1.a. Authority to Issue Warnings 
The authority for Officers in Charge, Mari ne Inspections (OC MIs) and Captains of 
the Port (C OTPs) to issue warnings in lieu of civil proceedings was granted by 
Presidential Memorandum dated April 21, 1995, which was br oadly implemented by 
the Coast Guard on July 14, 1995 vi a ALDIST 137/95, S UBJ: REGULATORY 
REFORM-WAIVER OF PENALTIES, and further expanded in message P 251943Z 
FEB 97, SUBJ: CIVIL PENALTY PROCESS.  The authority for OCMIs and 
Investigating Officers (IOs) to issue warnings in lie u of Suspension & Revocation 
(S&R) proceedings comes from 46 CFR 5.105. 
A.2.
NO“VERBAL”
WARNINGSAs a matter of policy, there are no “verbal” warnings.  What may have previously 
been called a  verbal warning is not authoriz ed.  Warnings shall be written an d contain 
the regulatory cite th at wa s violated and consequen ces for refusal or a statement tha t
the matter is being referred to the appr opriate agen cy with jurisdiction. 
A.3.NO LETTERS 
OF CONCERNAs a matter of policy, there are no Letters of Concern (may als o be referred to as 
“Local Letters of Warning”).  An example of  a Letter of Concern would be the Coast 
Guard expressing concern (versus issuing  a warning and/or operational control) 
regarding a potentially da ngerous situation within the port.  The previously issued 
Letters of Concern shall be issued as Letters of Warning (LO Ws) or as general 
correspondence with a reference to the Coast Guard being “concerned” ab out the 
issue.  
B.USE OF WARNINGS
B.1.GENERAL Enforcemen t action is th e next step b eyond educa tional efforts, no-consequence 
recommenda tions, compliance requirements, and r egulatory co ntrols imposed to 
minimize maritime risks.  It supports the overall goal of the Marine Safety, Security 
and Environmental Protection Progra m to pr omote the safety o f life and property at 
sea and to pr otect the ma rine environment.  The u se of warnings saves staff hours in 
processing violation cases  or preparing for a S&R p roceeding while still serving the 
 purpose of educating the public about fede ral laws and regulations and providing an 
acceptable level of deterrence against subsequent violations. 
B.2.WHEN A 
WARNING IS 
APPROPRIATEWarnings are used when taking enforcement a ction  that does no t meet the level of a 
notice of violation (NOV), Class I administra tive civil penalty, or S&R proc eeding.  
Warnings are appropriate for the majority of the offenses routinely encountered 
except those endangering life,  property or the environment.  See B.3. below for 
examples of when it is inappropriate to issue a warning in lieu of pursuing civil 
penalty or S &R proceedings. 
__________________________________________________________________ 
B.2.a. Disc harges of O il 
Enforcemen t action (LO W, NOV or Class I or  II Administrati ve Civil Penalty) shall 
be initiated o n all discharges of oil when the investi gation enables you to do cument 
each of the five (5) elements of an unlawf ul discharge.  The following categories of 
discharges of harmful quantities of oil as defined by table 1-C of COMDTINST 
M16200.3(series), Civil Penalty Procedur es and Administration, establish the 
maximum quantity of oil discharged in which the OCMI/COTP may opt to issue a 
LOW in lieu of issuing an  NOV or pursui ng a Class I or II Administrative Civil 
Penalty: 
•All Category A (non-commercial source) di scharges where the quantity of o il 
spilled is less  than fifty (50) U.S. gallo ns; and 
•All Category B (commerci al source) discharges where the quanti ty of oil 
spilled is less  than twenty-five (25) U.S. gallons 
A warning must be issued whenever Ci vil Penalty enforcement action is wai ved.   
No more than two (2) warnings shall be issued to a party for a discharge meeting the 
above criteria within a 12 month perio d. 
__________________________________________________________________ 
B.3.WHEN A 
WARNING IS 
INAPPROPRIATEIn general, warnings shall not be issued in lieu of Class II Administrative Civil 
Penalties or Criminal Enforcement a ctions.  The OCMI/COTP retains the a uthority 
to not issue a warning for any offenses for which a warning is authorized, if in their 
discretion th e Coast Gua rd’s enforcement goals would be better served by pursuing a 
higher level of enforcement (eith er Civil Penalty or S&R). 
__________________________________________________________________ 
B.3.a. Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Laws/Regulations
Warnings sh all not be issued in lieu of pur suing Civil Penalty action for the following: 
•Any violatio n that repres ents a significant threa t to health, safety, or the 
environment; 
•Any intentional violation;  
•A second vio lation of the exact sam e offense within a 2-year period; 
•Any second violation of different statu tes/regulations within a year period; or 
•When more than three vi olations of different statutes/regulations are 
 discovered during any single detection  activity. 
______________________________________________________________ 
B.3.b. Suspension a nd Revocation Proceeding s
Warnings shall not be issued in lieu of pu rsuing S&R proceedin gs for the following: 
•Acts or Offenses for which revocatio n is mandato ry or is sought as detailed  in 
46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61; 
•Offenses listed in the Ta ble of sugges ted orders in 46 CFR Pa rt 5 for which 
the minimum recommended order is a 3 month or more suspension;  
•Any second enforcement action again st a merchan t mariner’s credential 
within a three-year period. 
_________________________________________________________________ 
B.4.MARINE 
SAFETY PERSONNEL 
CONSIDERED 
“BOARDING 
OFFICERS” As a matter of policy, marine safety p ersonnel are considered “boarding officers” 
when applyi ng the written warnings for the violations listed in 33 CFR 1.08.  
Therefore, when issuing warnings for violat ions lis ted in 33 CFR 1.08, there  must be 
coordination between the offices working for the cognizant District Comma nder in 
order to meet the procedures required in 33 CFR 1.08-5.   
EXCEPTI ON:  Marine safety pers onnel are to follow the procedures of  
33 CFR 1.08-5 for the specific violati ons listed in 33 CFR 1.08-1(a)(7),  
33 CFR 1.08-1(a)(9), and 33 CFR 1.08-1(a)(11) only when they apply to unin spected 
vessels. 
NOTE :  The requirement that “a written warning may not be i ssued where the 
operator is required to be licensed,” un der 33 CFR 1.08-1(b)(1) ensures that a 
licensed oper ator is held to a higher standa rd than a recreationa l boater.  As a licensed 
operator a warning in lieu of civil penalty proceedin gs is not permitted for th ose 
violations listed in 33 CFR 1.08.  A civil penalty shall be pursued and the initiation of 
S&R proceedings may also be appropriate.  However, a warning in lieu of S&R 
proceedings is permitted if appropriate. 
__________________________________________________________________ 
C.PROCESS FOR WARNINGS
C.1.GENERAL Upon completion of the detection activity an d a determination  based upon review of 
the criteria a bove that a warning is appr opriate, a LOW shall be drafted using the 
templates pr ovided in Figures 1, 2 or 3 at the end o f this chapter , for signature by the 
appropriate unit personnel with “by direction” authority.  All warnings must be 
signed by the party issued the warning, or contain a statemen t detailing proof of 
receipt by th e party as described below. 
C.2.ISSUING A 
WARNING LOWs may be personally delivered to the pa rty or may be issued via the mai l.  Proo f 
of receipt by the party is r equired.  If the LOW is personally delivered to the party 
and the party does not im mediatel y accept it, or th e LOW is mailed to the p arty, a 
notation sho uld be entered in the signature block o f the unit co py explaining the 
 disposition of the LOW (e.g. mailed to par ty via certified mail, mailed to the party 
with return receipt attach ed, hand delivered at scen e, etc).  Warnings are considered 
accep ted wh en properly served and not dec lined in writing within 30 days after 
receipt by th e party.  Templates of LOWs issued in lieu of both civil penalty action 
and S&R proceedings are located in th e Figures at the end of this chapter. 
C.3.ACTION 
AFTER A WARNING IS 
DECLINEDRegardless of whether the warning is issued by the OCMI/COTP in lieu of civil 
penalty a ction or by the OCMI in lieu of S&R proceedings, a warning that is declined 
shall result in the initiation of the next le vel of enforcement (e.g. Notice of Violation, 
Class I Administrative Civil Penalty, or S&R proceedings). 
C.4.APPEALS OF 
WARNINGSWarnings issued under 33 CFR 1.08, may be app ealed under th e procedures  of that 
regulation.  Warnings issued by a Hearin g Officer may be appealed under 33 CFR 
1.07-70.  Warnings issued  by an ALJ may be appealed under the S&R process.  
Warnings issued by an I O may be su bject to review or reconsideration if requested in 
writing.  Warnings issued by an IO are not subject to an appeal because an appeal of a 
LOW issued by an IO wo uld be akin to non-acceptance and the next level of 
enforcement action shall be initiated, an a ppeal would be available at that level. 
C.5.FOREIGN 
VESSELSIssuing warnings to foreign vessels, personnel,  companies, etc., shall be treated in the 
same manner as discussed above. 
C.6.DATA ENTRY The issuance of all LOWs shall be documen ted in the Marine Information for Safety 
and Law Enforcement (M ISLE) data system in accordance with  the applicab le 
MISLE Process Guide.  The signed warning shall be scanned and electroni cally 
attach ed to the enforcem ent activity (s ee the MISLE Process Guide for scanning 
instructions).  The original signed warning shall be maintained i n the case fil e at the 
unit in accor dance with the Information and Life Cycle Manua l, COMDTINST 
M5212.12A (series) until further notice.  Additionally, for violations listed in 33 CFR 
1.08, if the signed warning is appealed, it is prima facie evidence for the follow-on 
civil penalty action and/o r S&R proceeding.

 A.1.GENERAL
A.2.DEFINITIONS A.2.a.  Deficiency 
A.2.b.  Violation 
A violation is any deficiency resulting from a failure to meet applicable U. S. statutory 
or regulatory requirements where sufficient evidence exists to initiate adminis trative, 
judicial, or criminal proceedings (including suspension and revocation hearin gs, civil 
penalty hearings, and criminal prosecution) as appropriate. 
A.2.b.1.  Major Violation 
A.2.b.2.  Minor Violation 
Minor violations are all civil penalty violations not classified as major. 
A.2.c.  Prima Facie Evidence 
Prima facie evidence is evidence good and sufficient on its face; such evidence as, in 
the judgment of the law, is sufficient to es tablish a given fact, or the group or chain 
of facts constituting the p arty's claim o r defense, and which, if not rebutted o r
contradicted,  will remain sufficient.  Prima facie evidence is evidence which,  if 
unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to  sustain a judgment in favor of the issue 
which it sup ports, but which may be contradicted by other evid ence. A.CIVIL PENALTIES
This chapter discusses the roles of the distri ct, unit prevention department personnel, 
and the civil penalty Hearing Office in th e disposition of reported violations of 
federal statutes or regulations.  Its purpose is to promote uniform procedures in the 
preparation and processing of civil penalty cases.  The governing regulations for civil 
penalty proceedings are found in Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, § 1.07 (33 
CFR 1.07). 
A deficiency is any conditi on, operation, or act pertaining to a vessel or facility that 
fails to meet acceptable standards including but not limited to those establis hed by 
applicable international conventions, U. S. laws or regulations, industry standards, 
equipment manufacturers recommen dations, "good marine practi ce," etc.  Examples 
include equipment which  is considered to be unsatisfactory for its intended purpose; 
vessel or facility operations which place persons, property, or the environment at risk; 
or inadequate response by personnel to contingency drills. 
Major violations are any criminal or civ il penalty violations of federal law or 
regulation which create a n immediate and cr itical risk to lives, property, or the 
environment. 
 A.2.d.  Nonconforming Vessel or Facility 
A.2.e.  Substandard Vessel or Facility 
Based upon the definition of substandard provided by Internati onal Maritime 
Organization Assembly R esolution A.466 (X II), a substandard vessel or facility is 
defined as any nonconforming vessel or facility whose hull, structure, machi nery, or 
equipment is  substantially below the standa rds required by U. S. law or international 
conventions, and whose deficiencies as a whole or  individually endanger persons, 
property, or present an u nreasonable risk to the marine environment.  
Conditions that could result in a vessel or  facility being regarde d as substandard 
include but a re not limited to the following:  
•The absence of principal equipment o r arrangement required by U. S. laws or 
international  conventions  (e.g., absence of required life boats, life preservers, 
fire hoses, or fire extinguishers);  
•Gross noncompliance of equipment or arrangement with relev ant 
specifications of U. S. laws or in ternational conventions (e.g., serious 
deficiencies of the lifesaving, firefigh ting, structural fire protection, steering, 
propulsion, c ommunicati ons, navigation, or cargo systems);  
•Substantial deterioration of the struct ure or its essential equip ment (e.g., 
severely wasted hull, deck, frames, or ha tch covers; or inoperative fire mains, 
inert gas systems, pollution prevention equipment);

ADMINSTRATIVE 
CIVIL PENALTYA vessel or facility is regarded as nonconformi ng when it fails to comply with one or 
more applicable requirements of U. S. la ws, regulations, or international con ventions. 
Noncompliance with operational standards re quired by U. S. la w, or international 
convention (e.g., personnel-related factors such as inability of responsible parties to 
perform duties, properly conduct drills, or communicate emergency procedures). 
B.TYPES OF CIVIL PENALTIES
A Notice of Violation (N OV) is a formal, wr itten notice of an apparent violation for 
which a pred etermined monetary pen alty is appropriate.  In all cases, the issuance and 
final disposit ion will be considered part of the relevant safety r ecord for use in future 
Coast Guard  activities. 
The Class I Administrati ve Civil Pena lty pr ocess is used when the issuance of a letter 
of warning ( See Chapter C2 for guidance on LOWs) or NOV is  not appropriate.  
These cases are adjudicated by the Co ast Guar d Hearing Office .  In all cases, the final 
disposition will be considered part of the relevant safety record  for use in future 
Coast Guard  activities.

C.1.GENERAL C.1.a.  Application of Civil Penalties 
C.1.b.  Selection of Charged Parties 
C.1.c.  Adjudication The Class II Administrati ve Civil Pena lty process is used only for certain violations of 
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended by the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) 
and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA).  It is typically pursued in egregi ous and  willful vio lations of these statutes 
where the m aximum penalty associated with a Clas s I Administrative Civil Penalty is 
deemed insu fficient to meet enforcem ent goals and  in cases where the Coast Guard 
wants to pur sue other non-monetary re quirements,  such as the creation of a n 
environmental compliance plan or other re quirements that may be imposed by an 
Administrati ve Law Judge (ALJ).  Class II Administrative Civil Penalty asses sments 
may be made only by an ALJ using the pro cedures  contained in 33 CFR Pa rt 20.  In 
all cases, the final disposit ion will be consid ered part of the relevant safety r ecord for 
use in future Coast Guard  activities. 
The Judicial Civil Penalty process is the pres entatio n of all relevant evidence and facts 
surrounding a specific offense to Federal District Court Judge for adjudication.  A 
Judicial Civil Penalty may be pursued for a wide variety of violations, but is usually 
reserved for egregious an d willful vio lations where the maximum penalties associated 
with a Class I Administrative Civil Penalty is deem ed insufficient to meet 
enforcement goals.  In all cases, the final disposition will be considered part of the 
relevant safety record for use in future Coast Guar d activities.   
C.CIVIL PENALTY PROCESS
The Captain of the Port (COTP), Officer  in Charge Marine Inspection (OC MI) and 
Federal On Scene Coord inator (FOSC) should normally initiate the civil penalty 
assessment process for all major non-criminal violations, for repeat offenders, and 
any minor violations which are not co rrected immediately by the responsible party, or 
any other ti me they d eem appropriate given the circumstances of a particular case. 
Civil penalty enforcement actions shou ld target thos e parties wh o can most 
effectively bring about compliance or a remedy an d those who need to be d eterred 
from committing future violations.  For vi olations where severa l parties can with 
equal effectiveness bring about compl iance or rem edy, then civ il penalty acti ons 
selected sho uld target those parties whose failure to comply req uires the greatest 
degree of correction.   
Civil penalties, other than more se rious FWPCA/CERCLA violations, are 
adjudicated by the Coas t Guard Hearing Office under 33 CFR 1.07 non-adversarial 
proceedings.  FWPCA/CERCLA violations ca ses may be adju dicated by th e Hearing 
Office as Class I Administrative Civil Penalty cases , adjudicated by Coast Gu ard 
Administrati ve Law Judges as Class II Ad ministrati ve Civil Pena lty cases under 33

Whenever a civil penalty case is pursued, the COT P, OCMI, or FOSC should 
normally require a Letter of Undertaking (LOU) or Surety Bond from the vessel 
owner, operator, or person in charge of  a foreign vessel as a por t state contr ol 
measure to assure payment of any subsequently  assessed penalty or fine.  Included at 
the end of th is chapter as Figure C3-1 is a standard LOU template. 
Information concerning apparent violati ons of federal law or regulation can be 
received from sources other than obs erving Coa st Guard units.  For example, local or 
other federal agency law enforcement personnel,  or private citizens, may report to the 
Coast Guard  the occurrence of an allege d reckless or negligent operation of a 
pleasure boa t, or other vessel type.  The district co mmander establishes policy 
regarding the scope and extent for the investigation of such reported inciden ts and 
establishes p olicy for processing civil pena lty cases  for their respective units.   Upon 
the completion of an investigation by a Coast Guard unit and the preliminary 
conclusion that a violation did occur, appropriate documentation is prepared.  All 
required entries shall be made into th e Marine Information for Safety and Law 
Enforcemen t (MISLE) data system in  acco rdance with the MISLE Investigations and 
Enforcemen t Process Guide.  When a n agency oth er than the C oast Guard conducts 
the investigation, that agency's investig ative report should be forwarded as pa rt of the 
civil penalty case and attach ed to the MISLE enforcement activity as correspondence.  
When an ear ly determination is made that an  investigation might be better conducted 
by another C oast Guard d istrict, or unit of that distr ict, and the o ther district has 
been consulted, the initial report and ot her information on the i ncident may be 
forwarded. 
Depending on the district commander’ s established policy regarding the processing 
of civil penalty cases, the case  will be prepared either at the unit or district level.  All 
civil penalty cases shall b e evaluated to d etermine whether th ere is sufficient evidence 
to establish a  "prima facie" (i.e., evidence ex ists to p rove all elements of the violation) 
civil penalty case.  Care must be taken to ensure that all of the evidence in support of 
the case is pr esent, i.e., the facts availa ble for development of key conclusio ns should 
accompan y those conclus ions.  If it is deter mined that a prima facie civil penalty case 
exists and it warrants assessment of a Class I Administrative Civil Penalty, the case 
should be prepared and s ubmitted to the Coast Gu ard Hearing Office.  These 
evaluations and submissions should be made in accordance with current program 
guidelines.  The case m ay be closed a ny time prior to its forwarding to the Hearing 
Office; for example, this might occur with the issu ance and a cceptance of a Letter of 
Warning.  If district policy requires civil pe nalty cas es to be reviewed by the district

A Class I Ad ministrative Civil Penalty enfo rcemen t activity shal l be created i n MISLE 
in accordance with the M ISLE Investigations and Enforcemen t Process Guide.  An 
enforcement activity can have any nu mber of alleged violations.  It may con sist of 
information on several alleged violations (of various laws or regulations) occurring or 
observed at the same time, or on several si milar alleged violations occurring over a 
period of time, but addressed by the si ngle enforcement a ctivity.  A single 
enforcement activity sho uld address a single  party; cases agains t other liable parties 
for the same incident are r equired to be a ddressed by separate en forcement activities.  
The submitted Class I Administrative Civil Penalty case is exa mined by the Hearing 
Office.  If the Hearing Office determines that ther e is not sufficient evidence to 
proceed, that there is any reason why penal ty action may other wise be inap propriate, 
or dismissed the case with out prejudice,  the case pa ckage and MISLE activity is 
returned to the submittin g unit with a wri tten sta tement of the reason for return or 
dismissal.  The submittin g unit can ch oose to either close the activity as “Closed – 
Administrati ve Action”, or to correct any deficiency and resub mit the cas e package 
and MISLE activity for further Hearing Office consideration.  There may b e other 
appropriate a ctions availa ble to the su bmitting  unit in disposition of the case (e.g., 
referral to the U.S. attorney as a crimi nal violation case).  If the Hearing Office 
determines that no violation occurred and dism isses the case with prejudice, the case 
package will be returned to the submitting unit and the MISLE activity will be closed.
The below s ections give an overview of th e role of the Coast Guard Hearing Office 
in the Class I Administrati ve Civil Penalty process.  They are pro vided for 
informational purposes and are not bi nding on the Coast Guar d Hearing Office or 
any Coast G uard Hearing Officer.  For a more detailed explana tion of the role of the 
Coast Guard  Hearing Office, see Com mandant Ins truction M16200.5 (series), Civil 
Penalty Hear ing Officer Procedures. 
Parties to Class I Administrative Civil Pena lty cases  are provided written notice that 
civil penalty proceedings have commenced.  The required notice will contain those 
items found in 33 CFR 1.07-20(b), including the amount of penalty that appears to be 
appropriate.  No penalty will be assessed unt il the alleged violator has been provided 
opportunity to reply, and the Hearing Office has considered any such reply and it has

A party has the right to be represented by counsel at all stages of a Class I 
Administrati ve Civil Penalty proceedin g.  Once the Hearing Office is notified that 
counsel or some other p erson (e.g., agent, managing operator, employer, or associate) 
will provide representation for the party, this  notice will be entered into the r ecord in 
the case and all subsequent communi cations  will be directed to that counsel or 
representativ e. 
An in-person hearing must be reques ted in writing by the party and must b e
supported.  Civil penalty hearings are open to  the public (including the news media 
and Coast Guard personnel), space permitting, for the purpose of observation.  No 
statements from, or disru ptions by, such observers will be tolerated.  The degree to 
which reques ts to be pres ent is honored, given limit ed space or s ome other 
constraint, is at the discretion of the presid ing hearing officer, or a senior supervising 
hearing offic er.  Portions of an in-pers on hearing may be closed if material of a 
confidential nature is to be offered or di scussed.  Participation by persons other than 
the party m ay be permitted ( see 33 CFR 1.07-50 and 55).  It is not necessary that th e 
hearing officer decide a case at th e close of an in-person hearing.  The volume or 
nature of the party's sub missions and testimony m ay require co nsiderable time for 
complete co nsideration, or the party may request time to make additional written 
submissions, or it may be appropriate to permit the program manager to review and 
rebut.  Also, the hearing officer may, at the close of the in-person hearing, state tha t a 
violation was shown to ha ve occurred, and then give the party a dditional time to 
provide furt her information before deciding on an appropriate penalty. 
The hearing officer must ensure that the party has been fully afforded the 
opportunity to view the d isclosable evidence and other substanti ve material in the 
party's case file.  The party has a right to examine a ll materials in the case fil e and to 
have a copy of all written documents.  This includes new eviden ce entered into the 
file after the party has been provided copies of the file or has otherwise been 
informed of the contents of the file. 
A party ma y request the a ssistance of the he aring officer in obtaining the appearance 
of a witness.  If the hearing officer d etermines that the personal appearance o f the 
witness may materially aid in the decision of the case, then an effort will be made to 
honor the request.  Should the hearing o fficer decide that the appearance or 
statem ent of the witness i s essential, but is unable to obtain eith er, the case can be 
remanded to  the submitti ng unit for further investigation.  If the hearing officer 
decides to deny the party's request, the party remai ns entitled to  produce the witness

regarding procedures sho uld be developed and ex plained com pletely to the agency 
and the party.  The hearing officer will main tain complete control of the hearing at all 
times. 
Hearing officers should caution parties making  requests for confidential treatment of 
their submissions that th e hearing officer's decisio n to honor such a reques t is subject 
to review.  Once the m aterial is entered into the record, third parties can req uest 
disclosure, and the reviewing authority in  the Coa st Guard ma y determine that the 
material is subject to discl osure.  Hearing officers w ill typically only accept material 
submitted wi th a request f or confidential  treatmen t after the party has been 
cautioned, a nd has reaffirmed the sub mission and the request f or confidential 
treatmen t. 
Each decisio n (i.e., wheth er a violation did occur and, if so, what penalty is 
appropriate) made in a ca se must be in  writing.  Decisions are not generally required 
to contain sp ecific and detailed finding of fact for all possible issues.  However, the 
disputed issues pertinent to the case wi ll typically be covered.  The record in a case 
must contain  the information that com pels or persuades the find ings.  The decision 
can be recor ded on "hear ing notes," with c opies provided for the party with the letter 
setting forth the decision, or written  into the body o f the letter itself.

C.4.REPORTS OF 
VIOLATIONS 
INVOLVING BOTH 
CIVIL AND CRIMINAL 
PENALTY PROVISIONSViolations of certain statu tes enforced  by the Coas t Guard entail both civil and 
criminal penalties.  For example, 46 U.S.C.  2302 provides for th e imposition of a civil 
penalty or criminal prosecution for grossly negligent operation o f a vessel that 
endangers the life, limb, or property of an y person.  [NOTE: Di scharges of oil or 
hazardous su bstances in q uantities whi ch may be h armful (see 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(3)) 
and the failure to report such discharges immediately (see 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(5)) are 
separate  offenses.]  When  such violations are reported, the district comman der shall 
determine whether or no t the imposition of a criminal penalty i s warranted.  If the 
evidence is sufficient and the circumstances  are such that a crim inal penalty i s
appropriate, the case sh all be referred to the U.S. attorney for action.  The district 
commander shall act on all reports of du al penalty violations as follows:   
•All reckless and negligent operation ca ses, whether or not  death or serious 
injury are involved, shall be carefully evaluated to determine whether the 
circumstances and docum entary evidence av ailable in the case warrant referral 
to the U.S. attorney for criminal prosecution.  
•Flagrant cases or cases involving re peated offenses  may be esp ecially 
appropriate for referral to the U.S. atto rney if the facts warrant s uch action.  penalty case as a whole were to continue.  For example, before coming to a decision 
on the facts i n a case, a co mparison of certain huma nitarian facto rs (as they af fect the 
party) with the need for completion of th e penalty case ma y per suade the hearing 
officer to dis miss the case.  All dismiss als will be explained on the record. 
The issuance of warnings in Class I Administ rative Civil Penalty cases is per mitted, at 
the discretio n of the Hea ring Officer.  The basis for a decision to give a warning in 
lieu of a monetary penalty should be explained on the record. 
Appeals of ci vil penalties are described  in 33 CFR 1.07-70 and 1.07-75.  Upon receipt 
of an appeal, the Hearing Office should provide a copy of the appeal and any 
supporting brief to the Coast Guard u nit that sub mitted th e case.  The Coast Guard 
unit will have 30 days to submit comments ; any comments made on an appeal should 
not include n ew evidence.   All of the germane evid ence should have been en tered 
into the file before the d ecision was made. 
The basis for the reopeni ng of a Class I Admi nistrative Civil Pe nalty case is described 
in 33 CFR 1.07-80.  The Coast Guard  unit that su bmitted the case will be given the 
opportunity to file comments in oppo sition to the petition to reopen. 
•When cases are referred to the U.S. attorney and prosecution is declined, the 
district com mander may,  at his discretion, refer the case to th e hearing officer 
for institution of administrative civil penalty proceedings.

PENALTY 
ENFORCEMENT 
OPTIONSThe Comma ndant's policy is to vigorously pu rsue a program of measures to achieve 
the Congressional intent, expressed in Section 1321, that there s hould be "no
discharges of oil or hazardous substances into or upon the navi gable waters of the 
United States, adjoining shorelines . . ." Discretion in making enforcement d ecisions 
should be exercised by th e OCMI/COTP in referring cases and by the Hea ring 
Office in deciding cases to best realize the purposes of the law.  The minimum level 
of enforcement that shall be pursued is th e issuance of a Letter of Warning in lieu of 
a civil penalty assessment.  (See Chapter C2 for guidance on LOWs for discharges of 
oil)  Evidence may warrant the impos ition of a minimal civil penalty, but in  any case 
the penalty s hould be strong enough to  motivate owners and operators to take 
adequate measures to prevent recurrences.  Commandant Instr uction M558 2.1 
(series), Noti ce of Violati on User’s Manu al, provid es guidance on the issuance of 
NOVs for discharges of oil.  In cases that the O CMI/COTP determines th at an 
assessment o f a civil penalty in an amo unt that exceeds the amo unts authorized for 
issuance of a NOV may be appropriate, th e case shall be pursued as a Class I 
Administrati ve Civil Pena lty, Class II Administrati ve Civil Pena lty or Judicial Civil 
Penalty as ap propriate.  It must be rem embered, ho wever, that i n any case, the 
determinatio n of the appropriate level of civil penalty enforcement must be b ased on 
the whole set of facts.  While one factor be aring on the gravity of the violation may 
be slight, another might be serious enough  to warrant a substan tial penalty.  For 
example, the fact that the amount spilled is extremely small may be offset by the 
careless conduct of the party.  Conversely, a high level of care by the party may be 
offset by a large quantity discharged. D.CIVIL PENALTY AUTHORITY UNDER THE FWPCA,AS AMENDED
Under Section 1321 of the FWPCA, as amended, (33 U.S.C. 1321), the Coast Guard 
is responsible for ensuring that reports of discharge under Secti on 1321 are 
investigated, and authorizes that every prov en violation may res ult in the ass essment 
of a civil penalty.  The OCMI/COTP is responsible for the investigation of 
discharges and referral of appropriate cases to the Coast Guard  Hearing Office.  The 
Hearing Office is responsible for adminis tering cases fairly and impartially, in 
accordance with 33 CFR  1.07, and fo r issuing  decisions based on the facts of the case 
and the appli cable laws an d regulations.  Action tak en by a state or municipality, or a 
federal agency other than the Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA), under 
Section 1321(b)(6)(B ) does not obviate the authority fo r appropriate Coast Guard 
civil penalty action to be i nitiated. 
The Coast Guard is authorized to assess a ci vil penalty against the owner, operator, or 
person-in-charge of a vessel or facility from which oil or a hazardous substance was 
discharged, in violation of Section 1321(b )(3), except for discharges which are 
forwarded, by interagency agreement o r unde rstanding, to a U.S. attorney or the EPA 
for action.  In every case in which there is substantial evidence that a violatio n 
occurred, civil penalty enf orcement a ction shall be pursued. 
 D.4.PROPER 
PARTY 
DETERMINATION
D.4.a.  Determining the Source 
D.4.b.  Determining the Owner/Operator When a prohibited discharge is established, two questions must be asked:  What is the 
source of the discharge?  and, Who is the owner, operator, or person-in-cha rge of 
that source?  As defined in Section 1321 (a)(6) the " owner" or "o perator" is a ny 
person owning, operating, or chartering by demise a vessel; or any person owning or 
operating an onshore or offshore facility.  In many cases, there i s more than one 
party subject to a penalty under the la w.  Strict con straints on th e selection o f a party 
may actually prevent Con gressional and Coa st Guard purposes from being served 
properly.  While the civil penalty provisi ons of Section 1321(b)(6) are based on the 
principle of strict liability, there is room for discretion in determining the actionable 
source and the person to be considered the owner, operator, or person-in-c harge of 
the source. 
Some time a go, the "con duit theory" was devised to assist in determining which 
vessel or facility, of a number of potentially action able sources, could most 
appropriately be considered the discha rge source for civil penalty purposes.  For 
example, oil may be disch arged from a source, flow across or through a facility or 
vessel of an otherwise in nocent party, and enter th e water.  In such a case, the 
owner/operator of the source  should normally be the actionable party in civ il penalty 
action; the v essel/facility from which the discharge ultimately en tered the water is 
viewed as a conduit only.  When the evidence indicates tha t the facility or vessel 
across or through which the discharge flowed was n ot merely a p assive conduit, 
identification of the actio nable source is complicated.  When two or more entities 
actively discharged oil or failed to take re asonable measures to prevent its entry into 
the water, an y or all of them may b e considered the source.  The OCMI/COTP shall 
evaluate all a vailable evidence, including causal factors and the capability for taking 
reasonable p recautions, to determine the a ppropriate actionabl e source (i.e., the point 
of entry and /or the actua l source). 
Once th e actionable source has been identified, it may be necessary to determine 
which of several parties is the "owner" or "operator" for civil pe nalty purposes.  
Section 1321(b)(6) is a remedial  provision intended to spur involved persons to adopt 
measures necessary for the preventio n of oil and hazardous su bstances poll ution by 
their vessels and facilities.  By reaching the owner, operator, or the person-in-charge 
of a violating vessel or facility, Congress ha s provided a flexible means of reaching 
those persons capable of taking such measur es.  While the qu estion of ownership is 
normally established easily, the intent of the law is not always served best by 
proceeding against the o wner; someti mes, it is more appropriate for the operator of 
the vessel or facility to be charged.  It is the Comm andant's poli cy that environmental 
protection la ws should be interpreted as broa dly as  possible, the terms "oper ator" and 
"person-in-c harge" are recognized as including persons not having complete business 
control of a vessel or facility.  Such persons may be considered proper parties if they 
 D.4.c.  OCMI/COTP Determination 
The decision  as to the pr oper party in  any particul ar case is vested in the dis cretion of 
the OCMI/COTP based on an evalua tion of all the facts of tha t case.  This discretion 
should be exercised in a manner which most reaso nably and effectively serv es the 
purposes of the law. The following factors should be considered:  
•The degree to which each involved party is responsible for the incident.  
•The degree to which each  involved party is in a position to prevent future 
incidents.  
•The effect of economic in centives on v arious involved parties.  
•Particular care shall be exercised in  identifying the owner, operator, or 
person-in-charge, in accordance with the guidance above.

77 
A.2.a.  46 USC 7703(1); Violation of Law/Regulation, 
Misconduct or Negligence A.INTRODUCTION
Violations of statutes and regulations enfo rced by the Coast Gu ard can result in the 
initiation of criminal or civil penalty action against the person responsible for 
committing the violation and/or the initiati on of administrative action against Coast 
Guard issued merchant mariner credentials (MMCs).  Enforcement tools available to 
the OCMI are discussed in Chapter C1 and procedures for proc essing civil p enalty 
violations are discussed in Chapter C3 of this manual.  This chapter provides policy 
guidance concerning the suspension and re vocation (S&R) process and includes 
discussions of pre-hearing actions, co mpla ints, answers, settlement agreements, 
hearing presentation, and  post-hearing actions.  Alternative acti ons concerni ng 
MMCs, including voluntary surrender agreem ents, voluntary deposit agreements, and 
good-faith deposits are al so discussed.  Letters of Warning are discussed in Chapter 
C2 of this manual. 
The basic au thority to initiate S&R proceedings is derived from Title 46, United 
States Code, Chapter 77.  46 USC 7703 establishes the bases for S&R proceedings 
and authorizes S&R actio n against a m ariner who, while acting under the au thority of 
his/her MMC(s) commits: a violation of a law or regulation intended to promote 
marine safety or to protect navigable water s, an act of misconduct, or negligence.  
The statute further autho rizes S&R action if a holder of a MMC committed a n act of 
incompeten ce relating to the operatio n of a vessel, was convicted of an offense that 
would prevent the issuance or renewal of th e MMC or is a threat to the safety or 
security of a vessel or a structure located within or adjacent to the marine 
environment.  Moreover, the statu te authorizes S&R action if a holder of a MMC was 
convicted an  offense listed in section 205( a)(3)(A) or (B) of the National Driver 
Register Act of 1982 (NDRA) (49 USC 30304 ) within 3 years of the initiation of a 
relevant S&R proceeding.  At the same  time, 46 USC 7704 authorizes S&R action 
against the holder of a MMC who has b een convicted of a dangerous drug law 
violation, or has been sho wn to be a u ser of, or addicted to th e use of, dangerous 
drugs.  46 USC 7702(d)(1) authorizes the Coast Guard to temporarily suspend a 
mariner’s MMC for vario us offenses discussed below.  The Coast Guard also has 
authority to i nitiate S&R proceedings against a MMC held by civil service or contract 
crewmemb er when possession of the MMC was a condition of employmen t, i.e. an 
individual hired to serve on a public vessel on the condition that he/she hold s a 
MMC.  This authority is set forth in Memorandums  of Agreement with the 
Commander,  Military Sealift Command (MSC), and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (ACOE) (see MSM Volume X). 
46 USC 7703(1) authorizes S&R actio n agai nst a mariner’s MMC(s) if, while acting 
under the au thority of the MMC(s), the mariner commits an a ct of miscon duct, 
negligence, or a violation of law or regu lation which is intended  to promote marine 
 A.2.b.  46 USC 7703(2); Conviction 
A.2.c.  46 USC 7703(3); NDRA Conviction 
46 USC 7703(3) authorizes S&R actio n if the holder of a MMC was convicted of an 
offense listed in section 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the NDRA of 1982 (49 USC 30304) 
within 3 year s of initiation of S&R proceedings.  Offenses listed in section
205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the NDRA are: 
•Operation of a motor veh icle while under the influence of, or while impaired 
by alcohol or dangerous drugs; 
•Traffic violation(s) arising in connectio n with fatal traffic accidents; 
•Traffic violation(s) arising in connectio n with reckless driving; or 
•Traffic violation(s) arising in connectio n with racing on the highways.

46 USC 7703(2) authorizes S&R actio n if the holder of a MMC was convicted of an 
offense that would prevent the issuance or  renewal of the MMC.  The Commandant 
considers convictions for offenses detailed in 46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61 to be convictions 
that would p reclude the is suance or renewal of MMCs.  The Commandant also 
considers a conviction for an offense listed  in tables  46 CFR 10.201(h) or 46 
CFR12.02-04(c), to be a conviction that wo uld prevent the iss uance or ren ewal of a 
MMC.  See section B.9 for guidance on appropriate sanctions.
See section B.9 for guidance on appr opriate sanctions. 
46 USC 7703(4) authorizes S&R actio n if the holder of a MMC has committed an act 
of incompetence related to the opera tion of  a vessel.  Incompetence is bas ed on the 
inability of a mariner to perform the du ties required of his/her MMC(s).  The 
inability to p erform may be due to pr ofessional deficiencies, physical disability, 
and/or mental incapacity.
46 USC 7703(5) authorizes S&R actio n if th e holder of a MMC is a security risk that 
poses a threa t to the safety or security of a vessel or a structure located wi thin or 
adjacent to the marine en vironment.  See section B.9 for guidance on appr opriate 
sanctions. 
46 USC 7704(b) authorizes S&R actio n against the holder of a MMC who, within 10 
years of the i nitiation of S&R proceedin gs, has been convicted of violating a 
dangerous drug law of the United States or  of a State.  The statute authorizes the 
suspension or revocation of the mariner’s MMC fo r such violations after the offense 
is found proved at a hear ing.  See section E for guidance on use of settlemen t 
agreements a nd section B.9 for guidance on appro priate sancti ons. 
 A.2.g.  46 USC 7704(c); Dangerous Drug Use 
A.2.h.  46 USC 7702(d)(1); Temporary Suspension 
46 USC 7702(d)(1) authorizes the Coast Guard to temporarily suspend a mariner’s 
MMC, fo r not more than 45 days, if c ertain conditions exist.  In temporary 
suspension cases, the mar iner must perform a safety sensitive function on a v essel 
and there m ust be proba ble cause to believe that the mariner: 
•Has while acting under the authority o f that MMC, performed the safety 
sensitive function while i n violation of law or regulation regarding the use of 
alcohol or dangerous drugs; 
•Has been co nvicted an offense that would prevent the issuance or renewal of 
the MMC.  The Comman dant considers convictions for offenses detailed in 
46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61 to be convictions that woul d preclude the issuance or
renewal of MMCs.  The Commandant also consi ders a conviction for an 
offense listed in tables 46 CFR 10.2 01(h) or 46 CFR12.02-04(c) to be a 
conviction that would prevent the iss uance or ren ewal of a MMC;  
•Has been co nvicted an offense listed in section 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the 
NDRA (49 USC 30304) within 3 year s of the initiation of S&R proceedings; 
or 
•Is a security risk that poses a threat to  the safety or  security of a vessel or a 
public or commercial structure located within or adjacent to th e marine 
environment.

been defined  in Comman dant Decisio ns on Appea l (CDOA) 25 35 (SWEENEY), 
2634 (BARRETTA), and 2638 (PASQ UARELLA ).  An individual is considered 
cured if: 
•He/she successfully completes an accredited drug abuse rehabilitation 
program designed to eliminate physical and psychol ogical dependence.  This 
is interpreted  to mean a p rogram certified by a governmental agency, such as 
a state drug/ alcohol abuse administration, or in the alternative, certified by an 
accepted ind ependent pr ofessional association, such as the Joi nt Commission 
on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO); and 
•He/she dem onstrates a complete non -association with drugs for a minimum 
of one year following the successful completion of the drug abuse 
rehabilitation program.  This includes participation in an active drug abuse 
monitoring program which incorporates  random, unannounced drug testing 
during that year; and 
A.3.f.  Conviction 
A.3.g.  Security Risk 
A mariner is considered a security risk if: 
•The mariner has a disqualifying crimin al offense, as described in 49 CFR 
1572.103; 
•The mariner has been adj udicated as l acking mental capacity or committed to A narcotic d rug, a controlled substance, or  a controlled substance analog as defined 
in section 102 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970 (21 
U.S.C. 8 02).
•A Medical R eview Officer (MRO) has determined that th e mariner is drug-
free and that the risk of subsequent us e of dangerous drugs is sufficiently low 
to justify the mariner’s return to work. 
An individual has been found guilty by judgme nt or plea by a co urt of record of the 
U.S., the District of Columbia, or any State or territory of the U.S. of a criminal 
felony or misdemeanor or  of an offense listed in section 205 of the NDRA.  For the 
purposes of 46 USC 7703 or 7704, the Coast  Guard considers an individual as having 
received a co nviction if the Court actio n is based on a plea of guilty or no con test or 
involves deferred adjudication or the imposit ion of a requirement to attend classes, 
make contrib utions of time or money, r eceive treatment, submit to any mann er of 
probation or supervision, or forgo appeal of the finding of the trial court.  The Coast 
Guard does not consider the convicti on expunged without proo f that the

A.4.
JURISDICTIONJurisdiction to initiate S&R action agai nst a MMC is established by either the 
individual being the holder of a MMC issued by  the Coast Guard, or by the individual 
acting under the authority of a Coast Gu ard issued MMC.  The offenses for which 
the Coast G uard must es tablish that the mariner was acting under the author ity of his 
or her MMC at the tim e of the offense are: 
•A violation or a failure to comply with a provision o f, or regulation issued 
under, Subtitle II of Title 46 USC; or a violation of or failure to comply with 
any law or regulation intended to pr omote marine safety or to protect 
navigable waters; or 
•An act of mi sconduct; or 
•An act of negligence. 
The offenses for which the Coast Gua rd has jurisdiction to initi ate S&R proceedings 
against a mar iner’s MMC simply becau se the individual is a holder of a Coast Guard 
issued MMC  are: 
•A conviction of an offense that would prevent the i ssuance or renewal of the 
MMC; or 
•Within 3 yea rs of the initiation of S&R proceedings, a mariner was convicted 
of an offense listed in section 205( a)(3)(A) or (B) of  the NDRA (49 USC 
30304); or 
•An act of incompeten ce relating to the operation of a vessel; or 
•The mariner is a security risk that poses a threat to the safety or s ecurity of a 
vessel or a structure located within or adjacent to the marine en vironment; or 
•The mariner has been a u ser of, or addicted to dan gerous drugs; or 
A.4.a.  Acting Under Authority of a MMC The above list identifies major catego ries of individuals who would be found to be 
security risks.  The list is not all-inclusive .  In addition to the ab ove, if there is 
probable cau se to believe that a holder  of a MMC has committed an act, or is going 
to commit a n act, affecti ng the safety or s ecurity of a vessel or a public or commercial 
structure located within o r adjacent to the marine environment, an IO may i nitiate 
S&R proceedings against the mariner’s MMC for being a security risk. 
•Within 10 years of initiation of S&R proceedings, the mariner was convicted 
of violating a  dangerous drug law of the United States or of a State. 
As defined in 46 CFR 5.57(a), an individual  who is employed in  the service of a vessel 
is considered to be acting under the au thority of his/her MMC when the hol ding of 
 A.4.b.  Use of a Dangerous Drug/Violation of Dangerous 
Drug Law 
A.5.
JURISDICTION AND 
PILOTSthe MMC is either required by law or regulation, or is required by an emplo yer as a 
condition of employmen t.  (See A.5. below for special circumstan ces for pilots).  
Mariners continue to act u nder the author ity of their MMCs duri ng periods o f time 
away from the ship while they are ser ving in the service of the vessel.  Mariners are 
also considered to be a cting under the authority of their MMCs when they ar e 
engaged in official matters related to their credenti als, including, but not limiting to, 
such acts as applying for renewal of th eir MMC, taking examinations for upgrading or 
endorsements, requesting duplicate or replacemen t credentials, a ppearing at a  S&R 
hearing, participating in the drug testing requirements of 46 CFR 16, etc.  The Coast 
Guard maintains jurisdiction over a ma riner with an expired MMC because S &R 
proceedings are taken against the mari ner's entitlement to the MMC.  CDOA 2656 
(JORDAN) also clearly states tha t a mariner may b e found to have been a cting under 
the authority of an expired MMC and that any subsequently assessed sanctions may 
be properly imposed on any subsequently issued MMCs (renewals, ect.).  It is worth 
noting, however, that the act of applyi ng for an original MMC is not an acti on 
performed under the authority of any subsequentl y issued MMC, since the 
application p recedes the i ssuance of the credential.  See CDOAs  2025 
(ARMSTRONG) and 2062 (O’CALLIGHAN). 
The Coast G uard has jurisdiction to initiate S&R proceedings against the hol der of a 
MMC who has ever been the user of, or addi cted to, a dangerous drug or has within 
10 years from the initiati on of S&R proceedings been convicted of violating a 
dangerous drug law of the United States or of a State.  There is no requirement to 
show that the mariner was a holder of a MMC at the time of the drug use/addiction 
or at the tim e of the con viction, it is only necessa ry to establis h that th e mariner is a 
holder of a MMC when the complaint is issued. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit decided that a s tate pilot, 
not required to hold a license under federal la w, is not acting un der the auth ority of 
the pilot's federal license, although it is re quired by the state bef ore it will issue the 
state licens e (SeeSoriano v. U.S ., 494 F. 2d 681 (9th Cir. 1974)).  The U.S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of Loui siana decided that the former 46 USC  214 does 
not, by itself, authorize pr oceedings agains t federal licenses held by pilots acti ng 
under the au thority of sta te licenses a t the time of the relevant i ncident ( SeeDietze v. 
Siler, 414 F. Supp. 1105, (E. D. La., 1976)).  The Commandant's policy is to follow 
the Soriano  and Dietze  decisions in all cases involvin g pilots acting under the authority 
of state com missions.  This policy does  not affect investigative procedures 
concerning casualties and civil violatio ns involving state pilots.  Pilots acting under 
the authority of federal lic enses are sub ject to investigation and may be issued a 
complaint u nder 46 USC Chapter 77 or be subject to civil penalty action, as 
appropriate.  Pilots acting solely under th e authority of a state li cense are su bject to 
civil penalty action for violations of applicable laws or regulations.  The Maritime 
Transportation Security Act (MTSA) OF 20 02; Pu blic Law 107- 295 increased the

WANTED LISTThe MISLE Wanted List has been esta blished to assist in locating merchant mariners 
wanted for the following S&R purposes: 
•Pending enforcement a ction; or  
•Acquiring in valid or revo ked MMC; o r
•Delivery of the ALJ’s D&O. 
Units are responsible for entering and removing names from the Wanted Lis t in 
MISLE.  IOs should routinely check the Wanted Lis ts during any personnel 
investigation.  IOs shall contact the unit th at placed the mariner on the list for details 
of action required.  The following actions will normally be required:  maximum civil penalty contained in 46 US C 2302(a) for neglige nt operations of a 
non-recreational vessel to $25,000.  IOs s hould strongly consider whether maximum 
civil penalties in cases wh ere a Pilot’s negligence contributed to a marine casualty are 
appropriate.  Any evidence of criminal violat ion of federal statutes may be referred to 
the local U.S. attorney by the District Co mmander.   If a violation is within the 
jurisdiction of a state or locality, the evi dence should  be referred to the cognizant 
state or district attorn ey.  All criminal refe rrals shall be made via the cognizan t Area, 
MLC or District legal office. 
It is not the i ntent of the Coast Guard  to use S&R proceedings to maintain discipline 
on merchant vessels.  Only if a disciplina ry problem constitutes a hazard to  life, 
property, or the environment or the problem constitutes a security risk to the marine 
transportatio n system, sh ould S&R proceedings be contempla ted. 
Procedures for handling applications for awards under the Equa l Access to J ustice 
Act are contained in 49 CFR Part 6.  The Act pro vides for retroactive paym ent of 
attorney fees and certain defense costs to certain persons issued a complaint under 46 
USC Chapter 77.  To be eligible, the complaint mu st have been dismissed, and the 
respondent must allege that the complaint was not substantially justified and must 
certify that h e or she meets qualifying requi rements of the act.  The ALJ hea ring the 
S&R case will also rule on the fee claim; the IO for the case may be required to act as 
the "operating administration counsel" as defi ned in the Act and in 49 CFR 6.  If that 
IO is no longer available, the OCMI fo r the unit that issued the complaint may 
designate an other IO to act in this ca pacity.  The burden of proving that the 
complaint was “substantially justified” re sts upon the Coast Gu ard.  "Substantially 
justified" means reasonable or "having a basi s in law and fact."  In light of p ossible 
additional costs imposed by successful claims  under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 
it is essential that IOs exercise careful ju dgment in issuing complaints.  However, the 
mere fact tha t the respon dent prevails at the h earing does not mean that the 
complaint was not substantially justified.  In all cases, IOs shall file a brief opposing 
the claim for fee.  Failure to do so may result in a fee award beca use the claim  is 
unopposed, even if the Coast Guard's action wa s "substantially j ustified."  Questions 
should be discussed with the servicing District legal office. 
 •Service of any document; maintain con tact wi th mar iner and request unit to 
forward the document fo r service. 
•Service and surrender of MMC; request the D&O,  maintain co ntact wi th the 
mariner and encourage him/her to co mply with D &O. 
•Pending receipt of the D&O, a written notice of suspension or revocation 
should be provided to the mariner using a format similar to Figure C4-1 
located a t the end of this chapter.  Verify that the mariner’s record is locked 
to ensure that duplicate, renewal, or upgraded MMCs are not issued pending 
receipt and s ervice of the D&O.  You can confirm that th e mariner’s MMLD 
record is locked by viewing his/her re cord in MMLD through MISLE, if the 
record is locked it will be noted on the main MMLD screen.  
•Surrender of MMC; verify that the ser vice of the D &O was ma de.  Seek 
surrender advising marin er that any use or service under a revoked or 
suspended MMCs may be considered to be a cri minal offense ( See 18 USC 
2197). 
A.8.a.  MISLE Enforcement Activity Status and Prompt 
Date 
A.8.b.  Removing Mariners from the MISLE Wanted List If the mariner persists in refusing to surrender, consult the servicing Area, MLC or 
District legal office to pursue referring the ca se to the U.S. attorney.  If the mariner 
claims that h is or her MMCs are lost, require the m ariner to complete a lost MMC 
affidavit, Figure C4–2 located at the end of this chapter. 
Once th e mariner is placed on the Wa nted List for one of the th ree reasons stated 
above, the E nforcement Activity shall  be pl aced in an “Open – Suspended” status.  
IOs shall also enter a pro mpt date tha t equals the expiration date of the MMC plus 
one year to a ccount for th e grace period pr ovided in 46 CFR Subchapter B.  For 
example; if the mariner’s MMC expire s on 15 Jan 2007, the date that should be 
entered as the prompt date shall be 15 Jan 2008.  The activity shall remain open until 
the prompt date passes a nd then an entry shall be made on the activity sum mary tab 
that th e activ ity is being closed since th e MMC is no longer valid, but if the mariner is 
subsequently located, the activity owner sha ll be contacted.  The status should then 
be changed to “Closed - Administrati ve Action.”  When the m ariner is wanted for 
pending enforcement action, the unit shall maintain control and ownership of the 
activity and r etain the cas e file locally.  Mariner’s can be removed from the Wanted 
List in accordance with the below section. 
Once a m ariner is located and the ap propriate action is taken, the unit with
ownership of the activity shall remove the mariner from the Wanted List.  Mariners 
may also be r emoved from the wan ted list if the statue of limita tions for the offense 
has elapsed or the MMC grace period da te has pass ed and the MMC is no longer 
valid.  When a mariner is removed because of the s tatute of limi tations expiration or 
the MMC is no longer valid, an entry sh all be made on the activity summary tab 
requiring not ification if the mariner is sub sequently located so that appropriate action

revoked or no longer valid MMC shall be advised that they mus t comply with the 
Administrati ve Clemency process to b e eligible to apply for a new MMC. 
When a mari ner is removed from the Wanted List because the s tatute of limi tations 
has expired, an entry simi lar to the following shall be made on th e enforcement 
activity sum mary tab: “MM/DD/YY:  Statute o f limitations for service of 
Misconduct Complaint expired, SNM removed from wanted lis t.  SNM shall be 
required to address his alcohol use before processing any future MMC application.  
MMLD record to remain locked.”  When a mariner who was wanted for pending 
enforcement action is removed from the Wa nted List because the MMC grace period 
has expired, an entry simi lar to the following shall be made on th e enforcement 
activity sum mary tab: “MM/DD/YY:  SNM removed from wanted list, MMD 
expired MM/DD/YY and is past 1 year gr ace period.  SNM sh all be required to 
address his drug test refusal before processing any future MMC application.  MMLD 
record to remain locked.”  When a marine r who was wanted to acquire a revoked or 
invalid MMC is removed from the Wanted List because th e MMC grace period has 
expired, an entry similar to the following shall be made on the enforcement activity 
summary tab: “MM/DD /YY:  SNM removed from wanted lis t, revoked License 
expired MM/DD/YY and MMD expi red MM/DD/YY and is past 1 year grace 
period.  SNM shall be required to apply for administrative clemency befor e

B.5.SAMPLE 
FACTUAL 
ALLEGATIONS
B.5.a.  Misconduct 
B.5.a.1.  Failure To Perform Duty 
The offense of failin g to perform duty is distinct from incompetence in that the 
former is a failure to perform, wherea s the latter is inability to p erform.  A person 
may neglect a duty by never entering upon it; such is an omission of action, rather 
than an act.  A duty ma y be imposed by la w, regulation, or custom in effect at the 
time of the o ffense.  When there is an in tervening cause (confin ement on th e ship or 
other relief from duty) for failure to perfor m, the allegation for the offense(s ) should 
be based on the actions fr om which th e relief from duty was bas ed.  [NOTE:  See 
CDOA 1533 (DONLAN)]  Sample factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about July 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
wrongfully failed (or refused) to perform watertender duties on the 1200-1600 watch. 
1.  On or about 0800, Au gust 1, 19 95, while the [v essel name] was at Lond on, 
England, respondent wrongfully failed (or refused) to report to work as a deck 
department day worker. 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, respondent was sleeping in the forecastle head and 
wrongfully failed to perform lookout duty on the 1200 -1600 watch. ¾Facts constituting Incompetence 
¾Facts docum enting the security risk to the 
safety or security of a vessel, facility, etc. 
In the following examples, sample factual allegations are provided for complaints 
issued for so me typical of fenses of misconduct, violation of law or regulation , 
negligence, incompetence, and dangerous dr ug offenses.  These examples a re not 
inclusive of every situation that may be encountered; they are intended to illustrate 
the most co mmon types of situations. 
Generally, a factual allegation for a complain t issued for misconduct must, on its face, 
allege facts, which fulfill the standards of  46 CFR 5.27.  The w ords of the factual 
allegation must allege that what was done was wro ngful.  Thus, if the action s alleged 
could, on the face of the factual allegation alone, be other than wrongful, the word 
"wrongfully" should be included.  The following examples provide factual all egations 
alleging offenses which amount to mi sconduct. 
 B.5.a.2.  Failure To Perform Duty By Reason Of 
Intoxication 
To sustain a factual allegation of failure to perform duty by reason of intoxication, it 
must be affirmatively proven that th e into xicated state of the res pondent was  directly 
or indirectly coupled with  the person's  failure to perform.  Sample factual allegation: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.a.3.  Disobedience Of A Lawful Command 
The authority of the ship's master to is sue orders is well establish ed (see  
46 USC 11501).  A command need n ot be issued directly by th e master, but may be 
transmitted by the mas ter through subor dinate officers.  No sta tute permits a 
mariner, either expressly or implicitly, to disobey a lawful order of a superior; a mate 
or engineer as well as the master (certa in statutory s afeguards provide a remedy to 
mariners in cases of abuse).  The relationship of master to mari ner is entirely 
different from that of the employer an d employee a shore.  A ma riner who questions 
a master's or der does so a t risk.  Whenever the basi s of a complaint is refusal or 
failure to obey an order, the evidence should show that th e order was not in  the 
nature of a request, that i t was properly communicated to the person issued the 
complaint, that it was lawful, and that it was directly connected with the safe 
operations o f the vessel.  The factual a llegations must tell what the comm and was 
and, unless obvious, the manner in which it was di sobeyed.  Sample factual 
allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about 1300, Ju ly 1, 1995, w hile the [vess el name] was  at sea, respo ndent was 
given a lawful command by [name of offi cer] to take his/her regularly assigned 
lifeboat stati on. 
2.  Respondent wrongfully disobeyed the order by failing to arrive at the station. 
1.  On or about 1300, Au gust 1, 19 95, wh ile the [v essel name] was at th e Houston, 
Texas, City Dock, was given a lawful command  by [name of C E] to change and clean 
fuel oil strainers on your watch. 1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while the [vessel na me] was a t the port of Oslo, 
Norway, respondent wrongfully failed (or refused) to stand the 0400-0800 gangway 
watch becau se respondent was intoxicated (o r was under the influence of alcohol). 
2.  Respondent wrongfully disobeyed the order by failing to change the strai ners. 
 B.5.a.4.  Assault/Assault And Battery 
In the following examples, several types of  assault or assault and battery hav e been 
set forth.  Assault has been defined as an attempt to touch another without 
permission, or as a placing of another in fear of bodily harm.  Battery is, then, a 
consummati on of the first type of assaul t.  Assault with dangerous weapon is  a 
serious breach of safety; assaults by ma riners on the master or other officers, whether 
or not resulting in injury, are grave offenses.  Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while t he [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
wrongfully assault the ma ster, [name].
2.  Responded brandished a 12-inch wrench in a thr eatening manner and offering to 
strike the ma ster. 
1.  On or about 1 June 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
wrongfully assaulted and battered a m ember of  the crew, Frank Jones, by bea ting him 
with his fists. 
1.  On or about July 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
wrongfully assaulted a m ember of the crew,[name] , by threateni ng him with a 9mm 
pistol. 
B.5.a.5.  Desertion 
This is the abandonment of a ship in which a mari ner has engaged to perform a 
voyage, before the expiration of the mariner's contr act and wi thout leave.  In 
maritime law, desertion means not mer ely an unauthorized absence from the ship 
without leav e, but unauthorized absence with  no intention of returning to its service.  
Intent, being a state of mi nd, is not open to direct proof but must be inferred from 
other facts.  Thus, to sustain an offense of desertion, proof of t he permanent absence 
from the vessel is essential to distinguish de sertion from failure to join.  Removal of 
all personal effects may in dicate th e intent to perma nently aband on.  However, the 
leaving of any of a mariner's effects ab oard the mar iner's vessel does not necessarily 
rebut an indicated intent not to return .  An individual may desert whether or  not the 
mariner takes his or her personal effects, and remo ving personal effects does not 
always establish desertion.  There are ma ny other ways of proving intent (e. g., 
statem ents, h ow long the individual was gone, and where the m ariner went).   In the 
case of deser tion, 46 USC 11501 p rovides fo r the "forfeiture of all or any part of the 
clothes or effects [which the deserter] leav es on bo ard."  (Obviously, if Congress had 
intended tha t desertion would not have occurred if clothes or effects were lef t on 
board, there would not b e a provision for the forfeiture of such effects.)  Sample 
factual allegation: 
 The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.a.6.  Theft And Robbery 
Theft (larcen y) is the taking and carrying away of a nother's pro perty with in tent to 
permanently deprive.  Robbery is the taking  of property by force or putting in fear, 
from the person or presence of another.  Wrongful possession of another's property 
is also misconduct.  Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about June 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at Liverpool, England, 
respondent wrongfully had in his possession certai n stores of the [vessel name]. 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while t he [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
wrongfully t ook possession of personal proper ty (a radio, watch, and two rings) of 
another member of the crew, [name] . 
B.5.a.7.  Failure To Account 
The Coast G uard considers that a pers on serving on a ship who  receives mo ney from 
others and fails to make a proper accou nting for it at the prescri bed time con tinues to 
act under the authority of his or her MMCs, to the extent th at the person m ay be 
issued a complaint for this offense after completion of the voyage.  Sample factual 
allegation: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or after a voyage which extende d between April 1, 199 5, and July 1,  1995, 
respondent was a purser aboard the [vessel name].
2.  Respondent collected [dollar amount] from a passenger, [name]. 
B.5.a.8.  Possession Of Alcoholic Beverages 
Law or regulation does not expressly prohibit the possession of alcoholic beverages 
aboard commercial vessels, except in certain instances as specified in 33 CFR 95.04 5.  
However, a vessel owner or master may prohibit such possession or use, either 
verbally, by written order, or through an employm ent contra ct with crewm embers 
(Shipping Articles, Form CG-705A, specifi cally warns crewmembers against having 
or bringing aboard "grog," i.e., any intoxica ting beverage).  Sample factual allegations: 1.  On or about April 1, 1995, respondent wrongfully deserted the [vessel name], at 
London, England. 
1.  On or about March 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
robbed another member of the crew, [i dentity of victim], of his wallet. 
3.  Respondent wrongfully failed to return the money to [name] at the conclu sion of 
the voyage. 
 The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On April 1, 1995, while the [vsl name] was at New York, NY, respondent 
wrongfully brought liquor aboard (or caused liquor to be brought aboard) the [vessel 
name]. 
B.5.a.9.  Possession, Use, Sale, or Association With 
Dangerous Drugs 
IOs shall not issue a complaint for misconduct if the evidence of drug use is a result 
of a positive chemical tests administered under 46 CFR part 16 o r 33 CFR part 95, in 
those cases I Os shall issue a complaint for drug use under 46 USC 7704(c).  A 
complaint for misconduct for use of a dang erous drug should be issued when the 
evidence of use is not a p ositive drug test, i.e. credible witness(es) observed the 
mariner using a dangerous drug.  The Com prehens ive Drug Abuse Prevention and 
Control Act of 1970 prohibits most activiti es involving narcotics (including opiates 
and cocaine) and marijuana.  21 USC 841 prohibits unauthorized  manufacture, 
distribution, dispensing, o r possession with  intent to do any of the above, of 
controlled substances (including narcotics and mari juana).  21 USC 952 prohibits 
importation of controlled substances without a permit, or except in accorda nce with 
regulations, as the Attorney General sh all prescribe.  21 USC 955 prohibits 
possession of narcotics and marijuana when arriving or departing the United States 
unless listed on the manif est.  21 USC 957 prohibit s import of controlled substances 
by anyone not registered to do so.  21 USC 802 defines "controlled substance," 
"marijuana," and "narcoti c drug."  21 US C 812 lists controlled substances, dividing 
them into five schedules.  The comple te schedules are listed in 21 CFR 1308.  
Marijuana, T HC, and heroin are in Schedule I; cocaine is in Schedule II.  In view of 
these compr ehensive provisions, particularly  21 USC 844, possession of narcotics or 
marijuana is presumed to be wrongful in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  
Possession, use, and any kind of dealing with narcotics or marijuana by U.S. 
merchant m ariners is considered amon g the most s erious offenses within the 
jurisdiction of the Coast Guard, and those for which S&R actions are usually 
required.  If a mariner commits an act of misconduct regarding possession, use, or 
association involving marijuana , 46 CFR 5.59(a) allows the ALJ to grant a sa nction 
less than revocation upon showing by the mariner that the possession, use, or 
association was the resul t of experiment ation and that th e mariner has submitted 
proof at the hearing of re habilitation.  See Section B.9 for guida nce on appr opriate 
sanctions an d Section E for use of settlement agreements.  Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while the [vessel na me] was a t Galveston, TX, 
respondent wrongfully had cocaine in his/her possession. 1.  On or about June 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
wrongfully had intoxicati ng beverages in his/her possession. 
 B.5.a.10.  Failure To Respond To Summons Or Subpoena 
The authority of the Coa st Guard to comp el the a ttendan ce of witnesses or the 
production of other evidence at an inv estigation or hearing is provided by 46 USC 
7705.  If a mariner serving under author ity of his or her MMCs is subpoenaed to 
appear as a witness or produce evidence, and fails to appear, S&R proceedings may 
be initiated. Sample factual allegation: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On March 31, 1995, respondent was issued a subpoena to appear as a wi tness in a 
hearing scheduled for October 1, 1995. 
2.  The subpoena was dul y issued and served by Ensign Frank Benson, Investigating 
Officer. 
B.5.a.11.  Harassment Of Passengers 
Passengers on vessels are entitled to pr otection from invasion of their privacy and 
from personal rudeness.  However, IOs may en counter great difficulty in obtaining 
evidence to s upport these allegations.  In cases involving minors, parents are 
reluctant to permit them to appear as wi tnesses or to be interro gated.  Also, when 
these situations arise on the outbound  voyage, passengers debarking in foreign ports 
can submit their testimo ny only by d eposit ion.  Several cases on appeal involve 
varying degrees of harassment, from re spondent wrongfully entering passengers' 
staterooms a nd addressing them with i mprope r language to committing overt acts of 
physical contact.  Where the act of physical c ontact is sexual in nature, IOs shall refer 
to B.5.b.3 as sexual abuse or contact is a vi olation of law.  Sample factual allegation: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.a.12.  Sexual Harassment 
Congress has enacted s everal laws to p rotect workers from intimidating, hostile, and 
offensive work places, and the marine work place is not exempt from these laws.  
Marine employers shall follow the rules established by the Equal  Employmen t
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to protect wo rkers from such an environment.  
Complaints made by mariners should be in vestigated promptly and tactfully.   IOs 
should advise victims unless a witness  or other proof can be found to verify that 1.  On or about August 1, 1995, while the [vessel n ame] was at New Orlean s, LA, 
respondent wrongfully sold and/or deliver to a crewmember, [name of person], a 
quantity of opium. 
3.  On October 1, 1995, respondent wron gfully fail to appear at the hearing. 
1.  On or about May 1, 1995, while the [vessel na me] was a t Hamilton, Bermuda, 
respondent wrongfully e nter the stateroom of  a female passeng er, [name of victim], 
and addressed her in improper language. 
 words or gestures occurred, a case might be hard to prove.  If an investigation finds 
that sexual h arassment ha s occurred aboard a docu mented vess el, S&R proceedings 
should be strongly considered against the person who committed the act.  The basis 
for the complaint of misconduct is 42 USC 2000e, and 29 CFR 1604.11, whi ch 
prohibit sexual harassmen t in the work place.  Sampl e factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about Aug 4, 1995, while the [vessel na me] was off loading cargo, 
respondent wrongfully made sexual gestur es towards Seaman [name of victim], 
making for an offensive work environment, and causing her to leave her station as a 
line handler. 
B.5.a.13.  Failure of Master to Stop Sexual Harassment 
Congress has enacted s everal laws to p rotect workers from intimidating, hostile, and 
offensive work places, and the marine work place is not exempt from these laws.  If 
the investigation finds the master of the vessel failed to stop th e behavior of the 
offending person, S&R proceedings shall be initiated.  Sample factual allegati on: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.a.14.  Improper Treatment Of Crew 
Maltreatmen t of crewmembers by the mas ter and officers, and the abandon ment of 
mariners in a foreign port , are offenses punishable by fine or imprisonment.  To 
constitute an offense under criminal statu tes, maltr eatment must be cruel and unusual 
punishment, induced by malice or hatred; th e abandonment of a mariner in a foreign 
port must be done malici ously and without justifiable cause.  The "borderline" in 
determining maltreatm ent is a fine distin ction between extrem e and unjustifiable acts 
and the auth ority under 46 USC 11501 of the master to punish mariners for 
disobedience or continued disobedience of lawful orders.  For example, the holding 
in irons of a mariner for continued refusal to bring coffee to the chief mate was held 
to be cruel and unusual punishment predicated  on an unlawful order.  In other cases, 
where marin ers were placed in irons fo r disobedience of a lawful order and 
punishment was temperately applied, no o ffense was committed.  Sample factual

wrongfully u sed his position as watch supervisor, b y telling AB [name of victim] that 
if he wanted to have preferred duties, he  should leave his statero om door unlocked

B.5.a.15.  Smuggling Or Failure To Declare Dutiable 
Merchandise In Domestic Or Foreign Ports 
The Coast G uard acts in conjunction with the U.S. Customs Service in the protection 
of revenue and prevention of smuggling acti vities; this is a deep ly rooted mission, 
from the birth of the Revenue Cutter Serv ice.  As in the prohibition against the 
importation of dangerous drugs, smuggling statutes provide that possession shall be 
deemed evid ence sufficient for a finding of guilty unless mitigating factors can be 
shown.  These provisions include smuggling into the U.S. and other countri es, and 
situations short of actual importation, wher e there has been an attemp t or intent to 
evade payment of lawful duties.  A complaint issued under 46 USC Chapter 77 
involving the  illegal importation of mer chandise, brought other than on complaint of 
a Customs Officer, should be processed in  cooperation with the Customs Service at 
the port where the offense occurred.  Sample factu al allegation:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.a.16.  Stowaways/Aiding Illegal Entry Of Aliens 
Stowing awa y, or the aiding, assisting, or  abetting of any person who stows a way, on 
a U.S. vessel with the intent to obtain transportation is prohibited by 18 USC 2199.  
The bringing into the U.S., harboring, or  concealin g, or attempting to do so, on 
board any vessel, of any alien not duly ad mitted by an immigration officer or not 
lawfully entitled to enter or reside in th e U.S. is prohibited by 8 USC 1324.  A case 
may occur in which a person has been disc overed to be on boar d a vessel illegally, 
and the pers on's residence status is un determined a t the tim e of the investigation.  In 
another instance, a conviction for harborin g or concealing an alien may have been 
obtained under 8 USC 1324, or criminal prosecution for one or more reasons has 
been underta ken by the U .S. attorney.  In cases involving alien smuggling rings, 
evidence at the S&R proceedings must be supplied through the testimony of the 
immigration officer, or the master or o ther ship's officer, having direct knowledge of 
the offense, rather than r elying on the disposition of the case b y the federal district 
court.  A situation may ari se where a m ariner aids a stowawa y (other than an il legal 
alien) by furnishing food and a place of concealm ent, although there is no evidence 1.  On June 1, 1995, while the [vesse l name] was at sea, respondent wrongfully 
imprisoned a member of the crew, [na me of crewmember], by confining him in irons 
in the Numb er 2 lifeboat. 
1.  On or about July 1, 1995, while the [vessel na me] was in S an Diego, CA, 
respondent wrongfully brought [attempted to bring] into the United States certain 
merchandise [articles, co mmodities] which co uld not lawfully enter the Un ited States 
until [(payment of tax or duty), (decl aration, invoice, or description of said 
merchandise on a manifest of ship's cargo)  required by the U.S. Customs Service had 
been met. 
 to show tha t the mariner aided the sto waway  to board the vessel.  While this is not 
specifically covered in 8 USC 1324, it  is considered misconduct equivalent to aiding 
the stowa way to board th e vessel.  Sample factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while t he [vessel name] was at S an Francisco, CA, 
respondent brought [attempted to bri ng] in to the United States, or concealed or 
harbored [attempted to conceal or har bor], an alien not duly ad mitted by a n 
immigration officer or not lawfully entitled to enter  the United S tates. 
1.  On or about June 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was in Hong Kong, without the 
consent of the master or owner, with in tent to ob tain transportation there for, 
respondent aided [abetted , assisted] to st ow away aboard [vessel name] a person, 
[name of per son]. 
B.5.a.17.  Failure to Join 
In the majority of instances, proof can be established by introd uction of the Shipping 
Articles showing the mariner's signature to sign on the vessel, and the corres ponding 
entry by th e master statin g the mariner's ab sence at the end of the voyage or at the 
time the crew "pays off.”  Certified copies of relevant Official Logbook entries made 
in accordance with 46 USC 11502 should supplement this evid ence.  Sampl e factual 
allegation:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.a.18.  Fraudulent Applications 
An original license or certificate of regist ry that is is sued upon submission of false or 
materially in complete inf ormation is void under the Coast Gu ard’s mariner licensing 
regulations.  See 46 CFR 10.205(f)(4); CDOA 2025 (ARMSTRONG).  If, during the 
course of an investigation, an IO deter mines that a mariner was issued an original 
license or cer tificate of registry after submitti ng an application that contained false or 
materially in complete inf ormation, IOs should inform the cognizant OCM I of that 
fact.  In such cases, the O CMI must notify the mar iner, in writing, that the license or 
certificate of registry is null and void and inform the mariner that, upon retu rn of the 
relevant license or certificate of regist ry, the appeal procedures in 46 CFR 10.204 
apply.   1.  On or about Septemb er 1, 1995, while the [vess el name] was  at Djakarta, Malaysia, 
respondent wrongfully aided and assisted a stowaway, [name of stowaway], illegally 
on board, by furnishing him with food and shelter. 
1.  On or about August 1, 1995, respondent wrongfully failed to join the [ves sel 
name] at Wilmington, DE. 
 While the authority to void an original li cense or cer tificate is in 46 CFR Pa rt 10, no 
such provision exists in 46 CFR Part 12 to void an original MMD.  However, the 
rationale shal l apply to MMDs as the pro cesses for obtaining the credentials are 
similar.  An individual can not posses s a va lid credential that was obtained by fraud.  
In order to hold a property interest an indi vidual must have a “legitimate clai m of 
entitlemen t to it.” ( seeBd of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth , 408 U.S. at 2709)  
Therefore an individual is not entitled to  a MMD he obtained by providing false or 
materially in complete inf ormation.  If, during the course of an investigation, an IO 
determines that a mariner  was issued an original MMD after submitting an 
application that contained false or materially incomplete information, IOs should 
inform the cognizant OC MI of that fact.  In such cases, the OC MI must notify the 
mariner, in writing, that the MMD is null and void and inform the mariner that, upon 
return of the relevant MMD, the appeal procedures in 46 CFR  1.03 apply 
Under 18 USC 1001 intentionally false or fr audulent statem ents or representa tions 
made in any matter withi n the jurisdiction of  any department or  agency of th e United 
States are pu nishable by a $10,000 fine or 5 years' imprisonment, or both.  Such cases 
can be forwa rded to the Area, MLC or District Commander wi th a recomm endation 
for referral t o the U.S. attorney.  Current policy req uires a mariner who has o btained 
a subsequently issued (non-original) MMC to be afforded an S&R hearing in such 
cases.  If a fraudulent application is disc overed during the application process , the 
MMC shall n ot be issued and the provisions of Volume III, Chapter 3, Section B, 
shall be followed.  If it is determined th at statemen ts in an application were not 
fraudulently made but were merely the result of an unintended misstatem ent or 
misunderstanding, IOs should remove any referen ce to fraud from the com plaint.  
See Section B .9 for appropriate S&R sanction guidance.  Sampl e factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On May 20, 2001, resp ondent submitted a signed CG-719B “Application for 
Merchant Mariner Document (MMD), License , or Certificate of Registry” t o Coast 
Guard Regional Examination Center, Toledo OH. 
2.  Respondent indicated that he/she had no criminal convictions by checking NO to 
the question “Have you ever been convicted by any court – including military court – 
for an offense other than a minor traffic violation?” 
3.  On April 13, 1999, respondent was  conv icted of assault and battery b y the U.S. 
District Court in Portlan d, OR. 
4.  (FRAUD) Respondent wrongfully submitted a fraudulent app lication. 
B.5.a.19.  Absence Without Leave (AWOL) and Absence 
Over Leave (AOL) 
Although both of these constitute unauthor ized ab sences, the f ormer includes the 4.  (FALSE INFO) Respondent wrongfully  failed to  provide full disclosure of 
his/her conviction record. 
 element of u nauthorized departure from the vessel.   Consequently, if a complaint 
against a mar iner for absence and evid ence indicates that the ma riner had authority to 
depart but di d not return when due ba ck, the factu al allegation should reflect AOL.  
No specific intent need b e proved; the act supplies the intent.  If a mariner on 
authorized leave is unable to return through no fault of his or her own, the mariner 
has not com mitted an offense.  For example, if it is verified that the mariner's 
absence was solely due to  the mariner's a rrest and detention by civil authorities, 
followed by acquittal in a  civil court, the mariner should be found not guilty of the 
factual allegation; the same rule applies to  an illness, which prevents the mariner's 
return.  However, when such absence is ca used by misconduct for which the mariner 
is convicted in a civil court or there is evidence produced during the hearing for 
AOL, it does not provide a defense to the complain t of unauthorized absence.  S&R 
proceedings should be brought for these offenses only when it can be establ ished 
that th e absence of the m ariner created a si tuation in which the safety or security of 
the vessel, pa ssengers, crew, or marine en vironment was advers ely affected.  The fact 
that th e absence created a  crew shorta ge below the complemen t required by the 
Certificate of Inspection (COI) usually establishes s uch an adver se effect.  Whether 
the ship was in a foreign or domestic por t does not itself deter mine the effect.  
Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, respondent was wr ongfully absent from the [vessel 
name] without leave, within 24 hours of the [vessel name]'s saili ng from London, 
England. 
1.  On or about April 12, 1995, respondent wrongfully remained absent from the 
[vessel name] beyond his /her authorized leave. 
B.5.a.20.  Refusal to Submit to a Required Drug Test 
46 CFR part 16 prescribes the minimu m standards, procedures, and means to be used 
to test for th e use of dangerous drugs.  It specifies the following required drug tests: 
pre-employment, periodic, random, Serious Marine Incident, and reasonable cause.  
It also defines “refuse to submit” as refusi ng to take a drug test a s set out in 49 CFR 
40.191.  Some of the reas ons why an i ndividu al is determined to have refused to take 
a drug test as set out in 49 CFR 40.191 are: 
•Failure to appear for any test (except a  pre-employment) wi thin a reasonable 
time; 
•Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing  process is complete; 
•Failure to provide a urine sample for any test requir ed by Part 16; 1.  On or about April 12, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent was 
wrongfully a bsent from his/her duties without authority. 
 •Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process, e.g., re fusal to empty 
pockets, beh aving in a confrontational way tha t disrupts the coll ection 
process, etc.; or 
•An MRO ha s verified that the individual has an ad ulterated or s ubstituted test 
result. 
IOs should familiarize themselves with th e contents of 49 CFR  40.191.  IOs shall 
issue a complaint for misconduct seeki ng revocation in any case where a M MC 
holder refuses to take a required drug t est, unless th e mariner provides a legitimate 
reason for refusing to take the test.  If a legitimate reason is provided, IOs have the 
discretion to issue a Letter  of Warning, or to issue a complaint s eeking an order of 
less than revocation.  See Section B.9 for guidance on appropriate sanctions.  Sample 
factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On April 13 2003, respondent was  informed by his/her marine employer that 
he/she had been selected for a random drug test. 
2.  Respondent was told to report to SJ Collection Inc to provide a urine sample. 
B.5.b.  Violation Of Law Or Regulation 
B.5.b.1.  Failure to Take Action to Stop Sexual 
Harassment 
42 USC 2000e and the regulations published in 29 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter XIV--
Equal Employment Opportunity Commissi on, Part 1604, Sec tion 1604.11 deal 3.  Respondent failed to report to the co llection site and never provided a urine 
sample for testing. 
The decision to issue a complaint for a violation of law or regulation, vice 
misconduct or negligenc e, should be based on the severity of the violation.  Example, 
a master inv olved in a collision who failed to properly post a look out, as required by 
Nav Rule 5, can be issued a complaint for a violation of law or regulation, 
misconduct, or negligenc e.  IOs should rese arch ap plicable laws and regulations, and 
their intent with regard to promoting marine safety, and the pr otection of n avigable 
waters.  IOs must look at the facts inv olved in the casualty and decide whether to 
issue the complaint for a violation of law or misconduct.  Recent legislation, i.e., Oil 
Pollution Act of 1990, and the Sexual Abuse Act o f 1986 have been codified in laws 
applicable to marine safety.  Other laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 
2000e), although not codified in laws dealing with marine safety, exist and a re 
applicable to promoting marine safety.  IOs should also seek a comparable sanction, 
i.e., if the law requires imprisonment, revo cation should be sought.  The following 
offenses and sample factual allegations deal wi th acts that may not be codified in laws 
or regulation specifically dealing with ma rine safety, but are of growing concern 
within the m arine industry.  The law o r regulation violated shall be cited in the factual 
allegations for all violation of law or regulation offenses. 
 specifically with sexual harassment.  The tie to m arine safety is made through the 
effects sexual harassment have on an i ndividual.  Sexual harassment crea tes an 
intimidating, hostile, and offensive work en vironment, which af fects a crewmember's 
work performance.  42 USC 2000e require s that employers m ust ensure th e work 
place is free from such behavior.  If an inve stigation indicates a master was  aware of a 
crewmemb er being sexually harassed, a nd no action  was taken to  stop it, a co mplaint 
against the master may be preferre d.  Sample factual allegation:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about May 1, 1995, the respondent was s erving as master on board the 
[vessel name]. 
2.  Responded received a report of sexual harassment; by Ordinary Seaman Smith, 
that AB [ offender] made suggestive comment s that were consid ered lewd an d sexual 
in nature. 
B.5.b.2.  Failure To Report A Sexual Offense 
46 USC 10104 requires the master, or  person in charge, to report to the Coa st Guard 
all complaints of sexual offenses that occur aboard  U.S. documented vessels .  The 
failure to report a sexual offense diffe rs from failure to take action regarding sexual 
harassment.  Sexual offen ses, as described in the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986, (18 USC 
Chapter 109A), are far more serious than sexual harassment because physical contact 
is involved.  The senten cing guidelines for sexual offenses are also more severe than 
sexual harassment.  If an investigation indicates tha t the master, or person in charge, 
of a documented vessel fails to notify the Coast G uard of a complaint deali ng with a 
sexual offense, S&R proceedings shall be initiated, and revocati on sought.  Sample 
factual allegation: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about May 1, 1995, responded was serving as master on board the [vessel 
name], a U.S. documented vessel. 
2.  Respondent received a report by Ordina ry Seaman [name], th at Bos'n [offender] 
forced her to have sex by threatening her with bod ily injury if she did not consent. 
B.5.b.3.  Sexual Abuse 
The guidance for specific violations covered under the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986 a re 
found in 18 USC, Chapter 109A.  If an in vestigation detects a violation described in 
18 USC 109A (aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, sexual abuse of a minor or 
ward, or abusive sexual contact) a complaint should be issued for a violation of a law 3.  Respondent failed to take action, which created a [hostile, intimidating, offensive] 
work environment, thus affecting the work performance of [na me], a violation of 29 
CFR 1604 .11, and 42 US C 2000e, Titl e VII. 
3.  Respondent failed to report the incident to the Coast Guard , a violation of 46 
USC 1010 4(a). 
 or regulation.  Misconduct should not be used, as misconduct i n 46 CFR Ta ble 5.569, 
carries only a 1-3 month suspension.  To reflect th e seriousness of an offense listed 
in the Sexual Abuse Act, the recommended senten cing guidelines for a conviction is, 
at a minimu m, imprisonment for not less than 6 months, and /or up to a $5000.00 
fine.  Accordingly, a requested sanction  of revocation would be a ppropriate.  IOs 
shall be careful conducting investigatio ns of cases involving sexual abuse due to the 
nature of the acts.  Care s hall be taken  to ensure th at the victim is not further harmed 
through improper questioning.  Sexual offe nses on documented vessels are a federal 
crime under 18 USC Chapter 109A, and may be appropriate for referral to the U.S. 
Attorney.  Sample factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On May 1, 1995, while the M/V SEA was moor ed in Norfolk, VA, respondent 
offered Seaman [name] brownies laced with LSD. 
2.  Respondent then had s ex with Seaman [name] when she was in an impaired state, 
a violation of 18 USC 2241(b)(2)(B). 
1.  On May 1, 1995, respondent forced  Ordinary Seaman [name], to have sex by 
threatening her with death if she di d not, a violation of 18 USC 2242. 
1.  On April 15, 1995, while the M/V SEA was at sea, respondent was found by the 
master to ha ve molested a minor fema le passenger, [NAME OF PERSON], by 
placing his hand on her private parts in a lewd and  lascivious manner, a violation of 
18 USC 22 43. 
B.5.b.4.  Possession Of A Dangerous Weapon Or Explosive 
Compound 
The carrying or possession by any per son of any dangerous weapon or explosive 
compound aboard a merchant vessel, wit hout prev iously obtaining the permission of 
the owner or  master of the vessel is prohibited by 18 USC 2277.  The wearing of 
sheath knives aboard ship without th e cons ent of the master is prohibited by 46 USC 
11506.  This prohibition is repeated on th e Shipping Articles, of which the master 
must inform every mariner offerin g to serve aboard his or her vessel.  Sample factual 
allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while the [vessel na me] was a t sea, the respo ndent had 
in his/her possession a dangerous weapon, a 32 caliber automatic pistol, without 1.  On May 1, 1994, while the M/V SEA was at s ea, respondent threatened to "bust" 
Seaman Smith's skull if she continued to fi ght off his attemp ts to fondle her buttock 
and breasts, after she had asked him to stop, a violation of 18 USC 2144(2) .
 permission of the master, a violation of 18 USC 2277. 
B.5.b.5.  Possession Or Selling Of A Switchblade Knife 
The possession or sale of a switchblad e knife aboard a U.S. vessel, in any location, is 
prohibited by 15 USC 1243.  In such cases,  the fact that p ermission was improperly 
granted by the master is i mmaterial.  Sample factua l allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about October 1, 1995, while th e [vessel name] was at sea, respondent had 
in his/her possession a switchblade k nife, a violation of 15 USC 1243. 
B.5.b.6.  Use Of Alcoholic Beverages 
Law or regulation does not expressly prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages aboard 
commercial vessels, except in certain instan ces as specified in 33 CFR 95.  Sample 
factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about August 1, 1995, while the vessel wa s at sea, resp ondent cons umed 
approximately two ca ns of beer, while st anding the 2400-0400 engineroom watch, a 
violation of 33 CFR 95.045. 
1.  On or about 1700, 1 October 1995, wh ile the vessel was at sea, respondent was 
found to be intoxicated as  defined by 33 CFR 95.020. 
2.  The respondent’s alco hol concentr ation in his/her blood was determined  by 
breath analys is to be .07 per cen t, a violation of 33 CFR 95.045.
1.  On or about 2200, 25 Decemb er 1995, while the [vessel na me] was a t sea, 
respondent was found to be intoxica ted as defined by 33 CFR 95.020 
2.  The respondent’s superiors observe d that his/her (manner, disposition, speech, 
muscular movement, gen eral appeara nce, or  beha vior, as appropriate) was affected by 
the consump tion of an intoxicant (specify  intoxicant, if known), a violation of 33 
CFR 95.0 45. 1.  On or about July 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent had in 
his/her possession an explosive compound, ni troglycerine, without permission of the 
master, a violation of 18 USC 2277 . 
1.  On or about November 1, 199 5, while the [vessel name] was at St. Thomas, V. I., 
respondent s old a switchblade knife to [n ame] a fellow crewmember, a violation of 
15 USC 12 43. 
 B.5.b.7.  Damaging Vessel, Stores, Or Cargo 
Willful dama ge to a vessel, its stores, or its cargo is prohibited under 46 USC  11501.  
Sample factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that:  
B.5.b.8.  Resisting Coast Guard Personnel In 
Performance Of Duty 
The forcible assault, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidation of, or interfe rence 
with any fed eral officer (including Coast Guard marine safety personnel) engaged in 
performance of official d uties is prohibited by 18 USC 111 an d 2231.  The use of 
deadly force or dangerous weapons in connection with these of fenses carries 
additional heavy penalties .  While such o ffenses occur infrequently, they interfere 
with law enf orcement activities and a compla int shall be issued whenever they occur.  
Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about April 1, 1995, while t he [vessel name] was at S eattle, WA, r espondent 
forcibly [assaulted, opposed, impeded, or intimidated] a U.S. Coast Guard officer, 
Lieutenant [ name], during the performance of  his official dutie s, a violation of 18 
USC 111. 
B.5.b.9.  Mutiny And Conspiracy To Commit Mutiny 
The several elements related to inciting or conspiring to mutiny (18 USC 2192) and 
the act of mutiny (18 USC 2193). The offe nses may occur whil e the vessel i s in a 
harbor (foreign or domestic) or on the high seas.  A rebellion by mariners against 
their officers on board a vessel anywh ere within th e admiralty j urisdiction of the 
United States may be pu nished as mutiny.  It is the Command ant's policy to seek 
revocation of MMCs in c ases of mutiny or conspiracy to commit mutiny (46 CFR 
5.61).  [NOTE: Issuance of a complaint shou ld be reserved for aggravated acts, 
attended by open revolt, usurpation of comma nd, tumultuous rioting, conspiracy to 
commit such  acts, and like offenses.  Simple disobedience of orders should be treated 
as misconduct.]  Sample factual allegation: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 1. On or about April 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent damaged 
the Number 4 lifeboat davit with a cuttin g torch, a violation of 46 USC 11501. 
2.  Respondent [assaulted,  opposed, impeded, or intimidated] LT [name] by [d etails]. 
1.  On or about Octob er 31, 1995, while th e [vessel name] was at Staten Island, NY, 
respondent [combined, conspired, or conf ederated ] with other members of the crew 
 B.5.b.10.  Unlawful Killing Of Another On Board 
Documented Vessels 
This factual allegation is patterned after those for murder and manslaughter under 18 
USC 1111 an d 1112, respectively.  It is th e Commandant's position that the wrongful 
taking of a human life on board ship or on shore, with or with out malice, intentional 
or not, should result in revocation of a mariner’s MMCs.  If a m ariner kills a nother 
human while on shore, the complaint should be issued for misconduct.  Sample 
factual allegation:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
B.5.c.  Negligence 
46 CFR 5.29 sets forth the definition of negligenc e.  Issuing a complaint ag ainst a 
mariner for a particular act of neglig ence based on specific evidence is alwa ys 
preferable to issuing a complaint to the indi vidual when the negligence is b ased solely 
on a presumption.  For this reason and wh enever practicable, evidence should be 
vigorously sought and fully developed con cerning any specific acts or omissions, 
which singly, or in combination, constitute negligent behavior.  See Appeal Decisions 
2455 (WARDELL) and 2465 (O’CONNELL).  A watch officer who fails to post a 
lookout while the vessel i s underway a t night or under conditions of restricted 
visibility is negligent.  A lookout that i s not alert an d fails to see an approachi ng 
vessel that is visible, and c onsequently fails to give warn ing to the bridge, is likewise 
guilty of negligence.  Sample factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On or about January 11, 19 95, wh ile the [vessel name] was approaching the 
Galveston, Texas, Sea Buoy, respondent failed to adequately fix the position of the 
[vessel name], contributing to th e grounding of the [vessel name]. 
1.  On or about April 13, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent fell 
asleep while on lookout duty on the fo recastle head . to make revolt or mutiny on board, a violation of 18 USC 2192. 
1.  On or about November 1, 1995, while the [vess el name] was  at sea [in foreign or 
domestic por t], respondent intentionall y killed [name], a fellow crewmember, with a 
fire axe, a violation of 18 USC 1111. 
1.  On or about June 29, 1995, while t he [vessel name] was navi gating on the high 
seas [in navigable waters of the United St ates], during conditions of restricted 
visibility, respondent failed to obtain or pr operly use information available from radar 
observations to determin e if a close quarter s situation was developing and/or risk of 
collision existed from the [ve ssel name] detected by radar. 
 B.5.d.  Incompetence 
As indicated in 46 CFR 5.31, a complain t for incompetence is based simply on 
inability on the part of a mariner to perform the duties required by the mar iner’s 
MMC(s).  The inability to perform may be du e to pr ofessional deficiencies, physical 
disability, and mental incapacity or du e to drug or alcohol abuse.  It must be further 
verified that the disability continues to exis t or may be presumed to exist at the time 
of the hearing.  In each instance, the complaint will simply be "incompetence;" the 
factual allegation will set forth the appropriate facts.  Profession al deficiency is, 
generally speaking, shown by a course of acti on over a period of time indicati ng that 
the mariner s hould not be allowed to continue to serve in his/her rating.  In some 
cases, such as ignorance of the Navigation Ru les resulting in a collision, it may be 
indicated by one incident. Sample factual allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On February 15, 1995, respondent i ncorrectly pl otted th e 2400 dead reckoning 
position for the [vessel na me] and was incompeten t by his acts a nd omissions while 
standing deck watches on  a foreign voyage. 
2.  Respondent demonstr ated that he did not possess and exercise the professional 
skills of an o rdinary, prud ent, licensed third mate. 
1.  On or about January 19, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at sea, respondent 
suffered fro m seizures and was thus unable to perform his/he r duties as able seaman. 
2.  On or about February 1, 1995, while the [vessel  name] was at sea, respondent 
suffered fro m seizures and was thus unable to  perform his/he r duties as able seaman. 
3.  On or about March 1, 1995, while the [vessel name] was at s ea, respondent 
suffered fro m seizures and was thus unable to perform his/he r duties as able seaman. 
4.  Respondent is presentl y still susceptible to seizures. 
1.  On or about March 17. 1995, respondent was f ound to be mentally incompeten t 
by Dr. [name], of the Jupiter Medical Cen ter, because of his/her addition to [alcohol 
or (name of drug)]. 
B.5.e.  Dangerous Drug Offenses 
Congress enacted 46 USC 7704 with the ex press p urpose and intent of removing 
those individuals who possess or use drugs from service in the United States 
merchant marine.  See House Report No. 338 , 98th Cong., session 177 (1983).
Complaints may be issued against mariners  for being a user of, or addicted to 
dangerous drugs and convictions for dang erous drug offenses under 46 USC 7704 
regardless of whether th e individual was serving under authority of his or her 
MMC(s) at the time of th e drug use or conviction. 
 B.5.e.1.  Use or Addiction to Dangerous Drugs 
IOs shall seek revocation of MMCs if a ch emical test administer ed under 33 CFR 
part 95 or 46 CFR part 16 indicates that  a mariner is a user of dangerous drugs.  
Mariners suspected of us e or addictio n shall be issued a compl aint in accor dance with 
46 CFR 5.35.  IOs should also issue complaints for use/addiction to dangerous drugs 
if the evidence of use is from a non-CG required test, i.e. a test conducted o n behalf 
of the marine employee in accordance with compa ny policy, an d not required by part 
16 or authorized by part 9 5.  CDOA 25 60 (CLIFTON) sta tes that “The mere fact 
that th e specimen collecti on was for a purpose other than one a uthorized an d subject 
to Coast Gu ard regulations is not reason to exclude the evidence.  Once agai n, as 
long as the evidence is relevant and material, and not inherently incredible, it can be 
considered in a suspension and revocation hearing.”  See also CDOA 2542 
(DEFORGE ) which sta tes “The Coast Guard, following the procedures of 46 CFR 
5, may offer evidence from any source, not only a drug test carried out pursuant to 
Part 16, to establish drug use in violati on of 46 USC 7704.”  Mariners should be 
given the opportunity to enter into a s ettlem ent agreement (see Section E) if he or 
she is willing to enter a rehabilitation program and prove non-association with 
dangerous drugs for 1 year after completion of a rehabilitation program.  If the 
positive chemical test wa s the result o f a required SMI test, IOs shall take the case 
before an ALJ, this type of case is not elig ible for settlement.  If the positive test was 
the result of a post casual ty test condu cted under the provision of 33 CFR 95, IOs 
should consider taking the case before an ALJ vice offering a settlement, esp ecially if 
there is other evidence th at the drug use c ontributed to the casualty.  ALJs may stay 
the order of revocation p ending the m ariner's completion of a drug rehabilitation 
program and demonstrati on of non-associati on with dangerous drugs for 1 y ear after 
completion of a rehabilitation progra m.  Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On [date] respondent t ook a [type test] drug tes t. 
2.  A [type sa mple] speci men was coll ected b y [collector name] of [collection  agency 
name]. 
3.  The respondent signed a Federal Drug Testing Custody and  Control Form. (if the 
test was 46 CFR Part 16 required test) 
4.  The [type sample] specimen was collected  and analyzed b y [name of lab] using 
procedures approved by the Department of Transportation. 
B.5.e.2.  Conviction of a Dangerous Drug Law 
Mariners who have been convicted of an y Federal or State dang erous drug law 
offenses, within 10 years before the b eginning of S&R proceeding, shall be issued a 5.  That specimen subsequently tes ted positive for [type drug] a s determined  by 
[name of MRO] a Medical Review Officer. 
 complaint in accordance with 46 CFR 5.35.  See Section B.9 for guidance on 
appropriate sanctions.  Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  Within the last 10 year s, the respondent was co nvicted of possession of narcotics, 
to wit: heroin, by the U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon. 
B.5.e.3.  Investigating Officer's Discretion (Marijuana 
Convictions) 
IOs may exercise discretion in not issuing complaints under 46 USC 7704(b)  for 
marijuana co nvictions only if the following guidelines are met.  Prior to issuing a 
complaint, IOs shall take into account th e intent of  46 USC 7704: the safety of life 
and property at sea.  The following  questions shall be addressed: 
•Is the marijuana convicti on more tha n 5 years old? 
•Is there evidence of the mariner’s good character since the ma rijuana 
conviction? 
•Is this the on ly narcotic related offense on the mari ner's record? 
•Is there any evidence of rehabilitation efforts? 
•Can you arti culate reason s for believing that the m ariner is no longer 
associated wi th drugs? 
•Did the mari juana conviction occur while the holder of MMCs rather than 
acting under the authority of the MMC? 
•Did the mari juana conviction involve simple possession (personal quantity) 
or one time use (experim entation) ra ther than trafficking? 
B.5.f.  Conviction of an Offense Preventing 
Issuance/Renewal of MMC 
Mariners who have been convicted of an offense that would prevent the issu ance or 
renewal of a MMC, shall be issued a compla int in accordance with 46 USC 7703(2) 
[Note: there is currently no regulatory cite for this offense].  The Command ant 
considers convictions for offenses detailed in 46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61 to be convictions 
that would p reclude the is suance or renewal of MMCs.  The Commandant also 
considers a conviction for an offense listed  in tables  46 CFR 10.201(h) or 46 
CFR12.02-04(c), to be a conviction that wo uld prevent the iss uance or ren ewal of a 1.  On or about September 18, 1995, respondent receive a convi ction from the State 
of Louisiana, for the sale and possession of opium. 
If the answer  to any of th e above is no , IOs shall issue a compla int for a drug law 
violation.  See Section B.9 for guidance on appropriate sanctions .  If all of the above 
criteria are met, IOs may i ssue a Letter Of Warning (LOW) instead of issuing a 
complaint.  If a LOW is issued, details of the case and justification for the course of 
action shall b e documenti ng in the MISLE warning enforcemen t activity. 
 MMC.  See Section B.9 for guidance on appropriate sanctions.  Sample factu al 
allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On May 27, 2007, the respondent wa s convicted of Criminal Sexual Conduct-
Fourth Degree, by the State of Michigan. 
2.  This is a conviction that would prevent the issu ance of the r espondent’s l icense. 
1.  On September 18, 2005, respondent was convicted of Aggravated Assault by the 
State of Louisiana. 
B.5.g.  Conviction of a NDRA Offense 
Mariners who have been convicted of an o ffense listed in sectio n 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) 
of the NDR A of 1982 (49 USC 30304) within 3 years of initiation of S&R 
proceedings shall be issued a complain t in accordan ce with 46 USC 7703(3) [ Note: 
there is currently no regulatory cite for  this offense].  Offenses listed in sectio n 
205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of the NDRA are: 
•Operation of a motor veh icle while under the influence of, or while impaired 
by alcohol or dangerous drugs; 
•Traffic violation(s) arising in connectio n with fatal traffic accidents; 
•Traffic violation(s) arising in connectio n with reckless driving; or 
•Traffic violation(s) arising in connectio n with racing on the highways. 
See Section B.9 for guidance on appr opriate sanctions.  Sample factual allegations: 
The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  On September 23, 2007, the respondent was co nvicted of driving while under the 
influence of alcohol and/ or drugs, by th e Superior Court of California, County of 
San Diego, South County Division. 
B.5.h.  Security Risk 
Mariners who have been deemed a s ecurity ri sk that poses a th reat to th e safety or 
security of a vessel or a structure located within or adjacent to the marine 
environment, shall be issued a complai nt in accordance with 46 USC 7703(5)  [Note: 
there is currently no regulatory cite for  this offense].  See Sectio n B.9 for guidance on 
appropriate sanctions.  Sample factual allegations: 2.  This is a conviction that would pr event the renewal of the respondent’s MMD.
1.  On September 18, 2007, the respondent was co nvicted evadin g an law 
enforcement officer with reckless driving,  by the Superior Court of California, 
County of San Diego, South County Division.
 The Coast Guard alleges that: 
1.  As of Ma y 27, 2008, the respondent was includ ed in the Fed eral Bureau of 
Investigation’s terror watchlist. 
2.  By inclusion on the FBI’s terror w atchlist, the r espondent poses a threat to the 
security of a vessel or a structure located within or adjacent to the marine 
environment. 
1.  On September 18, 2008, the respondent was denied a Transportation Worker’s 
Identification Credential by the Tr ansportation Security Admin istration. 
B.6.SPECIAL 
CIRCUMSTANCESB.6.a.  Oil Pollution 
A complaint issued for an oil pollution  incident may fall under negligence or 
misconduct, according to the circumstances.  An IO must review each case i n which 
S&R proceedings are being considered.  As in other S&R investigations, any other 
courses of action detailed in 46 CFR 5.105 are available.  This is a discretiona ry 
decision of IOs, based on facts develope d by investigation.  Sample factual 
allegations:  
The Coast Guard alleges that:  
[Negligence]  1.  On or about 1 April 199 5, respondent failed to adequately s upervise 
cargo loading operations of the Tank Barge XYZ347. 
2.  Approximately 500 gallons of oil was di scharged into the XYZ River, a navigable 
water of the United States. 
[Misconduct]  1.  On or about 1 July 1995, while assigned as person in charge of 
cargo oil transfer, respondent wrongfully wa s absent from the immediate vi cinity of 
the Tank Vessel [name], which was di scharging crude oil. 
2.  The respondent was not available to shut down cargo operations in a timely 
manner after  the cargo ho se burst. 
B.7.OPTIONS FOR 
RESPONDENTS2.   In denying the issuance of a TWIC to the resp ondent, TSA determined that th e 
respondent posed a threat to the security of a vessel or a structure located within or 
adjacent to the marine en vironment.
3.  Approximately 50 gallons of oil entered  the n avigable waters  of the United States. 
When issuing a complaint, the respondent should be advised of the options that are 
listed on the complaint and summarized below.  The respondent should be made 
aware that he will have to answer the alle gations or request an extension within 20 
days of receipt of the co mplaint.  If the respondent admits the allegations, an ALJ 
will issue an order and enter a sanction.  If the respondent denies any allegations, an 
ALJ will schedule a heari ng on the matter.  If the respondent requests an extension to 
file his/her answer, the request must expl ain why more time is needed and will be 
ruled on by an ALJ.  The respondent s hould also be made awar e that if he d oes not 
 B.8.
RESPONDENT’S 
RIGHTSWhen issuing a complaint, the respondent should be advised of his/her right to: 
•Have representation by co unsel at the hearing, and that counsel may be, but 
need not be, a lawyer ( NOTE: free legal aid may be available th rough the 
state bar or l egal aid services);
•Have witnes ses, records or other evidence subpoenaed; 
•Examine witnesses; 
•Cross-examine witnesses;
•Introduce relevant eviden ce into the record; and  
•Testify to facts or relevant in formation on his/her own behalf. 
B.9.PROPOSED 
ORDERThe complai nt must contain a proposed order.  IOs may use 46 CFR Table 5.569—
Suggested Range of an Appropriate Order— to assist them in determining an 
appropriate proposed order.  IOs should also refer to 46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61 for 
offenses for which revocation should be sought and relevant CDOAs which contain 
the Commandant’s position on the appropriate sanction for various offenses.  The 
proposed order on the complaint sho uld reflect the sanction I Os are seeki ng to have 
the ALJ impose at the co nclusion of the he aring.  IOs may prop ose the following 
sanctions: 
•Admonishment.  This is the least severe sanction that an ALJ can impose and 
is considered a formal warning from the ALJ.
•Suspension on Probation.  This sanction includes suspension of a specific 
period of time (e.g., 3 months) and probation of a specific period of time 
(e.g., 9 months).  This is commonly stated as “3 months suspens ion remitted 
on 9 months probation.”  The terms of probation (e.g., successful completion 
of anger management counseling, not be  issued a complaint for violation of 
the navigation rules, etc.) shall be listed on the co mplaint.  The suspension is 
deferred during the probation period and will only become effective if the 
mariner violates the terms  of probation. 
•Outright Suspension.  This sanction is an outright suspension of a specific 
period of time (e.g., 12 months).  This is commonly stated as “12 months 
outright suspension.”   file an answer, request for extension, or attend any scheduled hearing, he may be 
found in default.  Default constitutes a n admission of all facts alleged in the 
complaint and a waiver of a right to a hear ing.  If the ALJ finds the respond ent in 
default, a decision could be issued without any heari ng.  The respondent may request 
a settlem ent agreement with the Coast Guar d.  If an agreement is reached, a 
proposed settlement will be submitted  to the ALJ for review and approval.  If the 
ALJ approves the settl ement, a consent or der implementing the agreement will be 
issued. 
 •Suspension with Probation.  This sanction includes an outright suspension of 
a specific period of time (e.g., 3 month s) and a deferred suspension of a 
specific period of time (e.g., 12 months ) and probation of a specific period of 
time (e.g., 24 months).  This is commonly stated as “3 months outright 
suspension with 12 months suspension remitted on 24 months probation.”  
The probatio n period does not commence until co mpletion of the outright 
suspension.  The terms of probation (e .g., successful completion  of anger 
management counseling, not be issue d a complaint for violation of the 
navigation rules, etc.) shall  be listed on the complain t.  The deferred 
suspension will only become effective if the mariner violates the terms of 
probation. 
•Revocation.  This is the most severe sa nction that a n ALJ can impose and 
requires the respondent to immediatel y surrender the respondent’s MMC(s) 
to the Coas t Guard. 
B.9.a.  Proposed Order for Drug Use/Addiction Cases 
B.9.b.  Proposed Order for Drug Conviction Cases 
The appropriate order in dangerous drug law violation cases is u sually revocation.  
IOs shall ensure the following provisions are met before recommending a sanction of 
less than revocation or offering a settlement agreement. 
•It has been more than 3 years since th e convictio n or the con viction is the 
only drug law violation in the previous 3 years. 
•The convicti on involved personal use amounts (si mple possess ion, etc.) 
rather than trafficking/attempt to dis tribute. 
•The mariner can establish  cure as defined in sectio n A.3.e. The following sections provide additional guidance on the appro priate proposed 
order for certain offenses. 
The appropriate order for all use/addiction to da ngerous drug cases is revocation.  It 
is clear that Congress felt drug users a re a threat to  the safety an d security of life and 
property at s ea and the m arine environmen t and mariners must prove that they are 
cured of their drug use/a ddiction or their MMCs shall be revoked.  In general, 
mariners that have had no previous comp laints for drug use/addiction proved, or 
who have no t previously voluntarily deposited or surrendered their MMC due to drug 
use/addictio n may be offered a settlement agreem ent allowing them to prov e cure.  
If the positive chemical test was the result of a required SMI test, IOs shall take the 
case before a n ALJ, this type of case i s not eligible for settlement.  If the positive test 
was the resul t of a post ca sualty test co nducted und er the provision of 33 CFR 95, 
IOs should consider taking the case before an ALJ vice offering a settlem ent, 
especially if there is other evidence tha t the drug use contributed to the casualty.  See 
section E for more guidance on settlement agreem ents. 
If either of the first 2 provisions is not m et, the pro posed order shall be revocation.  
If the conviction meets th e first 2 provis ions but the mariner ha s not establis hed 
 B.9.c.  Proposed Order for Drug Test Refusal Cases 
B.9.d.  Proposed Order for Misconduct for the Use, 
Possession, or Association with Dangerous Drugs 
The appropriate order for most cases i nvolving misconduct for the use, wrongful 
possession, sale, or association with danger ous drugs is revocation.  If the act of 
misconduct r egarding the wrongful possession, use, or association meet th e following 
provisions: 
•Involved personal use amounts; 
•Did not involve the sale, distribution, intent to distribute, trafficking, or 
smugglin g of dangerous drugs; and cure, a settlement agreem ent may b e offered to allow the mariner to establish cure.  
See section E for more guidance on s ettlement agreements.  If the mariner meets all 
the above pr ovisions IOs may propos e a 12 month  suspension remitted on 2  years 
probation with the condition of the probation bein g that the m ariner is not convicted 
of a drug law  violation during the period of probation.   
The appropriate sanction to seek for most refusals to submit to  a required test for 
dangerous drugs is revocation.  CDOA 2578 (CALLAHAN) states th e reas on why 
the sanction for refusal to test should be  revocatio n, “Refusal to submit to a post 
incident chemical test rai ses a serious doubt about a mariner's a bility to perform 
safely and co mpetentl y in the future.  Furthermore, if mariners could refuse to 
submit to ch emical testin g and face a lesser order, it is difficult to imagine why 
anyone th at may have us ed drugs wo uld ever consent to be tested.  Cf. Exxon 
Shipping Co. v. Exxon Se aman's Union , 73 F. 3d 1287 (3d Cir. 1996).  See also CDOA 
2624 (DOWNS), and 2625 (ROBERTSON).  NTSB Order No. EM-201 (MOORE) 
modified the revocation sanction of th e ALJ that was affirmed by the Vice 
Commandant because the Coast Guar d has articulated a 12-24 month suspension as 
appropriate ( See 46 CFR Table 5.569) for refusal to  take a chemical drug test.  The 
decision further stated that NTSB will not uphold a sanction ex ceeding 24 months 
suspension without a clearly articulated explanati on of aggravating factors.  In all 
cases where IOs seek a revocation san ction, IOs shall provide aggravating factors to 
support revocation.  Aggravating factors may include, but are not limited to:  previous 
positive drug test, previous refusal to sub mit to drug or alcohol testing, other 
members of vessel crew testing positive or re fusing to submit to  testing, or previous 
violations of drug or alcohol  testing regulations or company pol icy.  If no aggravating 
factors exist, IOs should seek a 24 month suspension.  If a resp ondent provides a 
legitimate reason for not submitting to a required drug test, IOs may propo se an 
order of less than 24 months suspension.  Respondents that admit they are a user of, 
or addicted to dangerous drugs may be offered a standard drug use settlem ent 
agreement.  See Section E for more guidance on s ettlement agreements.  A 
respondent that has refused to submit to a post cas ualty chemi cal test shall not be 
offered a settlement agreement; IOs shall in stead ta ke the case to a hearing seeking 
revocation.

B.9.e.  Proposed Order for Fraudulent Application Cases 
B.9.f.  Proposed Order for NDRA Convictions 
The appropriate order for cases involving a conviction for an offense listed in  the 
NDRA shall be based on the following guidelines.  If within 3 years from the 
initiation of S&R proceedings: 
•There are 2 or more convictions which involved dangerous drugs or alcohol; 
or 
•There is 1 conviction that involved dangerous drugs or alcohol and 1 
conviction that did not i nvolve dangerous drugs or alcohol; or 
•The State h as revoked the mariner’s motor vehicle operator’s license; then 
The proposed order should be revocation. 
If within 3 years from the initiation o f S&R proceedings: 
•There is 1 conviction that involved dangerous drugs or alcohol; then 
The proposed order should be a reasonable number of months of outright An IO may propose an order of 12 m onths suspen sion remitted  on 2 years probation 
with the condition of the probation being th at the mariner is not issued a complaint 
for misconduct for the use, possession or a ssociation with dangerous drugs during 
the period of probation.  A Settlem ent ag reement may be offered if the mariner 
meets th e above provisions but canno t demonstrate cure, see S ection E for more 
guidance on settlemen t agreements. 
The appropriate order for all cases involving misco nduct for the submission of a 
fraudulent application for the issuance of a MMC is revocation.  The Commandant 
has held that where fraud in the procu rement of a license is proved in an S&R 
proceeding, revocation is the only app ropriate sanction.  See CDOA 2613 (SLACK), 
2570 (HARRIS), 2569 (T AYLOR), 2346 (W ILLIA MS) and 2205 (ROBLES).  Several 
CDOAs hav e recognized  that th ere is a distinct difference between a fraudulent and a 
false statement.  See CDOA 2663 (LAW), 2608 (S HEPHERD), 2456 (BUR KE), 1381 
(CLINTON) and 809 (MARQUES).  In CDOA 2 608 (SHEPHERD), the 
Commandant found that the submission of a false application is a lesser included 
offense of submitting a fraudulent applicati on.  If there is no actual or constructive 
knowledge that the statement is false, it shall be co nsidered a false statem ent.  
Conversely, if there is knowledge (actual or c onstructive) that the statement is false, it 
is intended to be misleading, or is reckle ssly made without kno wledge of its truth or 
falsity, it may be considered a fraudulent statement.   Actual kno wledge can b e
described as possessing “specific knowledge”  of some material fact.  If it is 
determined that statemen ts in an applicat ion were not fraudulently made bu t merely 
the result of unintended misstatem ent or misunderstanding (i.e., a false statement), 
IOs may propose a sancti on of a reasonable number months of outright suspension. 
 suspension.  The minimum recommended suspen sion should be at least equal to any 
remaining suspension period assigned by a State of the mariner’s motor vehicle 
operator’s license.  If the State has sus pended a ma riner’s motor vehicle licen se, but 
has issued th e mariner a restricted license allowing operation of a motor vehicle, the 
suspension period may be remitted on probation. 
If within 3 years from the initiation o f S&R proceedings: 
•There is 1 conviction that did not invo lve dangerous drugs or alcohol; then

B.11.ADDRESSThe proposed order should be a reasonable number months of suspension on 
probation.  The minimum probation period shou ld be at least equal to any remaining 
suspension period assigned by a State of  the mariner’s motor vehicle operator’s 
license.   
The appropriate order for cases involving a conviction for any offense similar to 
those detailed in 46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61, or a conviction for an offense listed in the 
tables of  46 CFR Subchapter B where the minimu m assessmen t period is more than 
1 year is revocation.  When the minim um a ssessment period in the tables of 46 CFR 
Subchapter B is 1 year, IOs may propose a sanction of a reasonable number of 
months based on the overall conviction record of the mariner. 
The appropriate order for all cases where the respondent is issued a complai nt for 
being a security risk that p oses a threat to the safety or security of a vessel or 
structure located in or adjacent to the marine environment is revocation. 
The complai nt must contain proposed dates and a l ocation for a hearing.  If there are 
issues with witness availability or reasons why a specific location is desired, you 
should state them in this section. 
Once a co mplaint has been served, a request to m ove the heari ng to any pla ce other 
than tha t specified on the complaint or  to change th e time or date must be m ade to 
the ALJ initially convening the hearing.  The ALJ will consider the nature of the 
request and the stated rea son(s) for it; unless a cha nge is ordered by the ALJ , the 
hearing will be held as scheduled.  When a mariner requests a change of venue 
directly from the Coast G uard, the ma riner sh all be directed to contact the ALJ at the 
address and telephone nu mber provided by the IO. 
The complai nt must contain the address, phone number, and fax number of the 
issuing CG Unit and the name, rank, and ti tle of the IO who filed the complaint.  
The respondent must als o keep the I O informed of any changes to their ad dress 
 B.12.SERVING

B.12.b.  Time Limitations for Serving Complaints 
The following are the tim e limitations established in 46 CFR 5.55 for servin g a 
complaint o n the respon dent for various offenses: 
•A complaint for drug use may be served at anytim e, there is no ti me 
limitation. 
•A complaint for drug convictions must be  served within 10 yea rs of the date 
of conviction.  
•A complaint for misconduct for an offense listed in 46 CFR 5.59(a) or 5.61 (a) 
must be served within 5 years of the offense or violation. 
•A complaint for all other offenses shall be served within 3 years of the 
offense or violation. 
B.12.c.  Service of Complaints Considered Complete 
The service of a complaint is considered complete when the m ethod of service is 
personal delivery and the complaint is: 
•Handed to the respondent; or 
•Delivered to the respondent’s office during business hours; or 
•Delivered to the respondent’s residence and service is made to a person of 
suitable age and discretion residing at the respondent’s residence. 
The service of a complaint is considered complete when the m ethod of service is 
certified mail or express-courie r service and the co mplaint is: 
•Delivered to the respondent’s residence and signed for by a person of suitable and/or phone number. 
IOs must file a complaint issued in a te mporary suspension case immediately after 
serving it to the respondent with the Docketing Center.  The rules for answers under 
33 CFR 20.308 do not apply.  The Respondent ans wers at a pre-hearing conference 
(which may be telephoni c).  The ALJ will sc hedule this conference as early as

Answer forms (Form CG-2639A) were created to give respo ndents a qui ck and easy 
way to file their answer.  IOs should prov ide this form to each r espondent.  An 
answer temp late is located within the invest igations community of CG Central and in 
the CG electronic forms library.  The answer form’s use is optional and respondents 
may file any answer that co mplies with 33 CFR 20.303. Once the AL J is assigned, the assignment or der will direct the parties where to file 
subsequent documents. 
After a com plaint has been filed with the Docketing Center and  served on the 
respondent, but prior to the commencement of  a hearing, if errors of substance are 
found in the complaint or  in the factua l allegations, IOs shall prepare, file with the 
Docketing Center and ser ve an amend ed complaint on the resp ondent.  The 
amended co mplaint shall replace the original  complaint and shall contain all required 
elements of a complaint l isted above i n section B.2. 
Complaint forms were designed so that IOs could address acts of misconduct, 
negligence, or violations of laws/regula tions in the field if no further investigation is 
needed to ini tiate S&R proceedings.  In most cases , there will be sufficient time to 
prepare a co mplaint in th e office.  IOs should use the electronic form templates 
provided in MISLE and within the invest igations community of CG Central until 
such time as submission of all S&R filings are required to be made within MISLE.

C.2.FIELD 
REQUEST FOR 
MARINER'S PRIOR 
RECORD 
("MERMARPER") IOs should seek to obtain prior disciplinary inform ation on mer chant mariners.  
This informa tion is known as a “MERMARPER.”  MERMARPER records initiated 
prior to impl ementation of MINMOD  (May  1992) are maintained by the National 
Maritime Center (NMC) on 3x5 index ca rds.  A MERMARPER request to NMC 
should indicate the comp lete name of th e respondent, respondent’s birth date, 
respondent’s current MMC number, and social security number; requests concerning 
more than o ne individual at a time ma y be combin ed.  IOs should also check the 
information available in MISLE, including the wanted list as well as contacting NMC
for a MERMARPER.  MERMARPER request s may be mad e to NMC by telephone 
or via the notify NMC function in the MISL E Enforcement Activity.  The mariner's 
prior disciplinary record should be obt ained through MISLE and from NMC prior 
to issuing a complaint, to determine whether:  
•A violation of a probationary order is involved;  
•An outstandi ng order is pending service;  
•Recidivism is a factor in the current offense; or  
•It should be considered a s matters in aggravation. 
C.3.REVIEW OF 
INVESTIGATIVE CASE 
FILESComplaint forms specifically designed for expedited hearings are available in MISLE 
and within the investigations community of CG Central.  When used, they should 
only be served in person upon the res pondent and  a copy immediately faxed to the 
ALJ Docketing Center. 
C.PROCEDURES PRIOR TO HEARING
The prior records will neither prove nor disprove the facts of the current offense, 
and shall not be used as the sole basis for issuin g a complaint.  If the current 
offenses are proved in a hearing, however, the prior record will be introduced as 
matters in ag gravation. 
IOs presenting the case shall be thoroughly familia r with all of the available 
evidence.  IOs shall ensure that all d ocume ntary evidence such as Shipping Articles 
and log entries have been  properly extracted and certified.

DECISIONS. 33 CFR 20.901 allows IOs to submit a motion requesting the ALJ issue a su mmary 
decision in all or any part of the proceedi ng if there are no genuine issue of material 
fact and the CG is entitled to a decisi on as a matter of law.  The motion m ust be 
filed no later than 15 days  before the d ate of the hearing and the respondent has 10 
days to oppose the motion.  Some scenarios which IOs may want to file a motion 
for a summary decision include, but a re not limited to: 
•The mariner has a conviction for an of fense listed in 46 CFR 5.59 or 5. 61 
within the pr evious 5 years. 
•The mariner has a conviction for a violation of a dangerous drug law. 
•The mariner has submitted a fraudulent application for a MMC with regards 
to the failure to disclose a conviction that would have prevented the issuance 
of the MMC. 
C.8.MANDATORY 
DISCOVERYIn order to prevent surprise in S&R proceedings, the parties are required to share 
information about the evidence th ey intend to present at th e hearing.  The rules for 
discovery can be found at 33 CFR Part 20—Subpart F.  At least 15 days before the 
scheduled hearing, the parties are to ex change: 
•Witness Lists which include the nam e of each witn ess and a brief summary 
of their expected tes timony; and IOs must prove to the ALJ, by substanti al evidence of a reliable and probative 
nature, that the allegations made again st the respon dent are true.  Prior to the 
hearing, IOs should prepare the evidence in chronological order.  It is helpful to 
prepare a list of questions for each witness.  IOs are reminded that there is n o 
substitute for adequate pl anning and careful preparation of a case. 
The Docketi ng Center assigns an ALJ to hear the case under  
33 CFR 20.201.  IOs will receive a copy of the assignment order.  The order directs 
the parties where to file motions and other filings. 
The ALJ considers the hearing location request in the complaint and the ans wer and 
schedules th e hearing with a scheduling order.  The following table shows th e 
general guidelines for sch eduling: 
Then the ALJ schedule s the hearing to 
begin within... 
25 da ys of the temporary suspension. 
45 days of the filing o f the Answer. 
30 days from  close of discovery. 
Questions concerning the use of the s umma ry deci sion option should be addressed 
to CG-5451. 
 •Copies, marked as exhibits, of each document intended to be introduced as 
evidence or used in the p resentation o f the case. 
C.9.OTHER 
DISCOVERYAny other discovery will only be at the or der of the ALJ and will occur only when 
the ALJ determines that: 
•It will not unreasonably delay the proceeding;  
•The information sought is not otherwise obtainabl e;  
•The information sought has significa nt probative value;  
•The information sought is neither cu mulative nor repetitious; and  
•The method or scope of the discovery is not unduly burdensome and is the 
least burdens ome available.

CONFERENCES AND 
STIPULATIONSC.10.a.  Authority For Prehearing Conferences 
C.10.b.  Discussions At Prehearing Conferences 
Matters appr opriate for discussion and agreement at the prehearing conference 
include, but are not limited to: 
•Methods of service and filings; 
•Motions for consolidation or severance of parties or issues; 
•Motions for discovery; 
•Identification, simplification, and clarification of is sues; 
•Requests for amendmen t of the pleadings; 
•Stipulations and admissions of fact an d of the content and auth enticity of 
documents;  
•Offers of set tlement; Parties must request further discovery by motion. 
33 CFR 20.501(a) authorizes any party (IO,  respondent, ALJ) by motion to request a 
conference.  Unless the ALJ excuses a party,  the failure of a party to attend o r
participate in  the conference, results in the party waiving all objections to an y 
agreements r eached in it a nd to any co nsequent ord ers or rulings.  At the outs et of 
the conference, the judge will normally advise the participants that the proceeding is 
being conducted in accordance with the prov isions of 33 CFR 20.501.  Although the 
conference may be informal, all remarks should be addressed to the ALJ.  The ALJ 
should permit reasonable discussion; however, when a subject is  fully ventilated, the 
ALJ will rule  and move on.  ALJs may conduct prehearing conferences for the 
settlemen t or simplification of issues involv ed in a case with th e consent of the 
Coast Guard  and the resp ondent.  This aut hority comports with the provisions of 
the Administrative Procedure Act, wh ich specifically permits such proceedin gs (see 
5 USC 556 ( c)(6)).  In or der to establi sh maximum flexibility in the conduct of such 
conferences, no fixed rules are establis hed; however, the following guidelines have 
been provided to the ALJ s and will normally apply: 
 •Proposed date, time and pl ace of the hearing; and 
•Other matter s that ma y aid in the disposition of the proceeding.

C.11.a.  Who May Take Depositions 
C.11.b.  Requests For Depositions 
33 CFR 20.605 provides t hat an ALJ ma y order a deposition only upon a showing of No one may stenographic report or othe rwise reco rd a conference without the 
authorization of the ALJ.  During th e conference, the ALJ may depose of an y 
procedural matters on which they are authorized to rule.  Actions taken at the 
conference, if authorized by the ALJ, ma y be memorialized in stenographic report, 
or a written transcript from a magneti c tape  or th e equivalent, or the ALJ may make 
a statement on the recor d at the h earing summarizing the actio ns taken at the 
conference.
33 CFR 20.605 contains the regulations go verning depositions.  A deposition is the 
recording and transcribing of testimony under oath of a person who is not going to 
be present at the hearing upon the approv al of the ALJ of a motion made by any 
party.  Depositions are generally required because the witness is located beyo nd the 
range of a subpoena to require the witness to attend the hearing.  A deposition taken 
under oath a nd bearing the signature of the depon ent is admiss ible in a proceeding.  
This testimo ny is generally taken thro ugh oral examinations similar to those 
employed at the hearing.  It may also be videotaped  or taken via telephone 
conference call upon such terms, conditions, and arrangements as are prescribed in 
the order of the ALJ.  For simplification,  where on ly specific answers are required, 
prepared questions and cross-questions fr om the respondent are approved by the 
ALJ, read to the deponent and answer ed, and returned to the judge, who will admit 
them subject to the rules of evidence.  These are ca lled interrogatories or cross-
interrogatories.  Live testimony via tel ephone  may be the prefer red alternative to a 
deposition (See section G.8).  Assistance in preparing for a deposition may be 
obtained from the servicing District legal division. 
The depositi on may be taken before any disinterested person authorized to 
administer oaths in the pl ace where th e depos ition is to be taken.  Within the Coast 
Guard, this includes com missioned and warrant officers and tho se persons 
specifically engaged in the performance of duties under 46 US C Chapter 77.  
Outside the Coast Guard , this includes a judge, magistrate, commissioner, clerk of 
court, notary public, or judge advocate of  an armed service.  Within a foreign
country, a deposition may be taken bef ore a person having power to administer 
oaths in that location, or before a secr etary of an embassy or legation, consul 
general, consul, vice consul or consular agent of the United States, or before such 
other person or officer as may be agreed upon by the parties by written stip ulation 
filed with the ALJ.   
 good cause and upon a finding that: 
•The information sought is not obtainable by more readily alternative 
methods; or 
•There is a substantial reas on to believe that relevant and probative evidence 
may otherwi se not be preserved for presentation at the hearing. 
Any party m ay file a moti on requesting that testim ony be taken  by depositio n.  The 
motion must contain the following: 
•The purpose and scope of the deposition; 
•The time an d place it is to be taken; 
•The name and address of the person before whom the deposition is to be 
taken; 
•The name an d address of each witn ess from whom a deposition is to be 
taken; 
•The documents and materials which the witness is to produce;  
•Whether it is  intended tha t the depositi on be used a t a hearing instead of live 
testimony; a nd 
•If the deposition is to be by oral exam ination, by written interrogatories, or a 
combination  of the two. 
C.11.c.  Procedure 
C.11.d.  Objections Upon a showing of good cause the ALJ may enter, and serve upon the parties, an 
order to obta in the testim ony of the witness 
The person presiding over the deposi tion shall place the witnes s under oath or 
affirmation, and the oth er parties shall have the right to cross-examine.  The witness 
being deposed may have counsel or another representative present during the 
deposition.  The party requesting the deposition shall make appropriate 
arrangements for necessary facilities and personnel.  The testimony shall be taken 
stenographically and trans cribed at the expense of the party requ esting the 
deposition.  Unless waived by the deponent, the tr anscription must be read  by or 
read to the d eponent, subscribed by the deponent, and certified by the person 
before whom the deposi tion was taken.  See C.11.e. below con cerning videotaped 
depositions. 
Objection to  taking a deposition because of the disqualification of the officer before 
whom it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition 
begins, or as soon as the disqualificati on becomes known or could have been 
discovered with reasonable diligence.  During  the taking of a deposition, a party or 
the witness may request suspension of the de position on the grounds of bad faith in 
the conduct of the examination, oppression of the witness or party, or improper 
questioning or conduct.  Upon request for suspension, the deposition will be

taking of the deposition. 
33 CFR 20.605(n) authorizes tes timony at a deposi tion hearing to be recorded on 
videotape for subsequent presentation at an S&R hearing.  Visual observation of a 
witness’s demeanor can assist the AL J in making credibility evaluations.  
Videotaping expenses are to be borne by  the party requesting the recording.  
Testimony may be taken through oral ex amination  or by interrogatories.  The 
person requesting the videotape d eposition is responsible for procuring appropriate 
equipment for playback a t the hearing.  IOs should verify this to ensure that delays, 
or worse, do not result from the attem pted use of incompatible equipment.  The 
deposition becomes a p art of the recor d of the proceedings in the same man ner as a 
transcribed deposition.  The videotape, if admitted into evidence, will be played 
during the hearing and transcribed into the record by the reporter. 
Often the su bject matter of a hearing will be  of interest to other agencies, such as 
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Immigration and 
Naturalizatio n Service (INS), the FBI, or  local law enforcemen t agencies.  As 
appropriate, local representatives of th ese interests should be advised of the time 
and place of such hearings. 
At any time prior to the hearing, IOs ma y issue su bpoenas to s ecure the attendance 
of witnesses or the production of books, papers, or other evidence that may be 
needed by the Coast Guard or by the res pondent.  During the hearing, the ALJ may 
issue subpoenas for such purposes or upon request of the Coast Guard or the 
respondent.  46 USC 7705 provides the authority to issue subpoenas and is 
implemented  in 46 CFR Part 5, Subpart F.   The subpoena may be served anywhere 
within the ju dicial district in which it is to be retur ned, or if outside the district, at a 
place within 100 miles of the pl ace to which it is returnable. 
Occasionally, an IO may want to with draw the co mplaint prior to the convening of 
a hearing: a last minute v oluntary dep osit or voluntary surrender agreement may be 
completed, a dditional evidence ma y indicate th at the complaint i s unwarranted, or it 
may be deter mined that complaint wa s not  properly served in accordance with 33 
CFR 20.304.  If the respondent has not serv ed a responsive pleading (i.e. Answer), 
IOs shall submit a notice of withdrawa l to the Docketing Center with a copy to the 
respondent.  If the respondent has filed a responsive pleading, IOs shall file a 
motion for withdrawal with the Do cketing Ce nter with a copy to the ALJ (if an ALJ 
has been assi gned) and respondent. 
Investigations shall be conducted to p rovide, as thorough information as po ssible, to 
determine what official action, if any, should be ta ken against mariners or the 
mariner’s MMC(s).  S&R proceedings need not be used in all instances, but r ather

availability of other corrective action, the pr ior history of the mariner, and the likely 
impact of such action on similar incidents in the future are facto rs, which should 
influence the choice of actions taken.  Consideration must also be given to the 
responsibilities of masters, owners, and ope rators of vessels in maintaining the 
standards of competence and disciplined conduct i n the U.S. Merchant Marine.  
Civil penalty action agains t holders of MMCs is authorized at th e discretion of the 
OCMI.  Additional civil penalty guidan ce is c ontained in Chapter C3 of this manual.  
The following sections provide guidance on other a lternative actions. 
46 CFR 5.105(e) authorizes IOs to issue Letters of Warning (LOW) in lieu of 
pursuing S&R action.  Details on the issuan ce of LOWs are contained in Chapter C2 
of this Manual. 
Under the provision of 46 CFR 5.201, a Vo luntary Deposit can only be offered in 
cases where there is evidence of menta l or physical incompeten ce.  A medical
condition by itself is not incompetence; for example, an epilepti c who can co ntrol 
the condition through medication should not be issued a complaint for 
incompeten ce unless evidence is availa ble that his p rofessional performance is 
hindered by his condition.  If the condit ion prevents the mariner  from performing 
duties directly related to the safe opera tion or navigation of the vessel, a voluntary 
deposit may be properly considered.  Prior to accep ting a voluntary deposit, IOs 
shall explain to the mariner that the d eposited MMCs cannot be returned until the 
Coast Guard  receives sati sfactory evidence th at the mariner is considered fit for duty 
without qualification, and that th e mariner must initiate action to regain his or her 
MMCs.  If the mariner agrees to th ese conditions, IOs shall com plete a Volu ntary 
Deposit Agreement, Form CG-2639F, in du plicate.  After the mariner has signed 
both copies i n ink, IOs shall give the original to the mariner and retain a cop y in the 
case file.  The form shall be scanned a nd attach ed to the MISLE enforcement 
activity as correspondence.  IOs shall not ify NMC via the notify NMC function in 
the MISLE Enforcemen t Activity req uesting that the mariner’s record be locked 
while the M MC is on deposit.  Form CG-2639F  is available within the investigations 
community of CG Central and in the CG electroni c forms library. 
When a mari ner who has been certified by proper medical authority as physically or 
mentally incompetent will not voluntarily deposit his/her MMC s, S&R proceedings 
shall be initiated. 
 C.15.d.1.  Voluntary Deposits In Drug Investigations 
C.15.d.2.  Acceptance Of Voluntary Deposits 
Where the m ental or phys ical incompetence of a ho lder of MMCs is caused by use 
of, or addiction to dangerous drugs, a voluntary deposit will only be accepted 
contingent o n the following circumstances: 
•The holder intends to enroll in a bona fide drug rehabilitation program;  
•The holder's incompeten ce did not cau se or contribute to a m arine casualty;  
•The incomp etence was r eported to th e Coast Gua rd by the ind ividual or any 
other person and was not discovered as a result of a Federal, State, or local 
government investigation; and  
•The holder has not voluntarily deposited or surrendered his/her MMCs, or 
had his/her MMCs revoked for a drug related offense on a prior occasion. 
C.15.e.  Voluntary Deposit Of MMCs For Alcoholism As A 
Cause Of Incompetence 46 CFR 5.201(b) discusses the use of a vo luntary deposit where the mental or
physical inco mpetence ha s occurred resulting from the use of, or addiction to 
dangerous drugs.  The use of a voluntary deposit is only appropriate in those 
instances wh ere the use a nd/or addiction is not  discovered as a result of a Federal, 
State or local government investigation, i. e. the mariner voluntarily admits his drug 
problem.  The discovery of a drug pr oblem through the chemical testing 
mechanisms of 46 CFR 16 or 33  CFR 95 is considered to be discovered as part of an 
investigation and therefore a voluntary deposit shall not be used.
IOs shall screen all requests for volun tary deposit to ensure that the request has not 
been prompted by a Coas t Guard man dated chemical test.  This includes ma riners 
who are scheduled to take a test, but feel , or know they will have a positive result, 
and those who have been notified by a MRO of a positive test.   All cases shall be 
handled thro ugh the voluntary surrender, settlement agreement or hearing process.  
Voluntary deposits, which were promp ted by a posi tive chemical  test, shall be 
considered " null and void" and the M MCs returned to the mari ner, together with a 
complaint and an explanation of the options available. 
If the mariner agrees to these conditio ns, IOs shall complete a Voluntary D eposit 
Agreement (Drug or Alcohol), Form CG-2639G,  in duplicate.  After the mariner has 
signed both copies in ink, IOs shall give the original to the mar iner and retain a copy 
in the case file.  The unit copy of the form shall be scanned and a ttached to th e 
MISLE enforcement acti vity as correspond ence.  IOs shall notify NMC via the 
notify NMC function in the MISLE Enfor cement Activity requ esting that th e 
mariner’s record be locked while the MMC is on deposit.  Form CG-2639G is 
available within the investigations community of CG Central and in the C G

 C.15.e.1.  Voluntary Deposits In Alcohol Abuse 
Investigations 
In considering whether to initiate S&R pr oceedin gs for offenses  involving alcohol, 
IOs must recognize the di stinction between th e disease of alcoh olism and mere 
intoxication or alcohol abuse.  It is not intended that misconduct involving m ere 
intoxication should be punished any di fferently than instances of "sober" 
misconduct.  However, if alcoholism, alcohol  abuse, or intoxication is considered to 
be a factor in  the case, it i s appropriate to issue a co mplaint for "incompeten ce based 
on alcoholism," in addition to any mi sconduct co mplaint.  On this basis, cases 
involving alc oholism should be handled in a manner similar to other cases of 
physical or mental inco mpetence.  The Respondent may prod uce probative evidence 
of rehabilitation which may influence a fi nal determination regarding the mariner's 
competency.   To support the return of vo luntarily deposited MMCs, IOs may accept 
similar evidence. 
C.15.e.2.  Acceptance Of Voluntary Deposits 
Where the m ental or phys ical incompetence of a ho lder of MMCs is caused by use 
or addiction to alcohol, a voluntary deposit  will only be accepted contingent on the 
following circumstances:  
•The holder intends to enroll in a bona fide alcohol rehabilitation program;  
•The holder's incompeten ce did not cau se or contribute to a m arine casualty; 
and  
•The incomp etence was r eported to th e Coast Gua rd by the ind ividual or any 
other person and was not discovered as a result of a Federal, State, or local 
government investigation. physical inco mpetence ha s occurred resulting from the use of, or addiction to 
alcohol.  The use of a voluntary depos it is only appropriate in those instances  where 
the use and/or addiction is not discovered as  a result of a Federal, State or local 
government investigation, i.e. the mariner voluntarily admits his alcohol problem.  
The discovery of an alcoh ol problem throug h the chemical tes ting mechanisms of 46 
CFR 4.06 o r 33 CFR 95 is  considered to be  discovered as part of an investigation 
and therefore a voluntary deposit shall not be used.   The Coast Guard recognizes 
alcoholism as a disease a nd acknowledges th at there are succes sful programs for the 
prevention a nd treatmen t of alcoholism.  It is not the Coast Gu ard's policy to 
compel merchant mariner s with alcoh olism to enter such programs, but rath er to 
encourage sincere individuals to obtai n the medica l help they n eed.  While the Coast 
Guard canno t endorse or recommend a specifi c facility or program, IOs should be 
familiar with locally available resources in order to provide info rmation to merchant 
mariners requiring assista nce of this nature. 
If the mariner agrees to these conditio ns, IOs shall complete a Voluntary D eposit 
Agreement (Drug or Alcohol), Form CG-2639G,  in duplicate.  After the mariner has

A mariner may voluntarily deposit his /her MMCs with the Coast Guard in any case 
where there i s evidence of mental or p hysical inco mpetence as described ab ove.  A 
voluntary deposit is accepted on the basis of a written agreem ent, the original of 
which will be given to the mariner, which specifies the condition upon which the 
Coast Guard will return the MMCs to the holder. 
Where the conditions of paragraphs C.15 .d.2 or C.15.e.2 above are not met, the 
mariner may only surrender his/her MMCs in accordance with 46 CFR 5.203, or 
S&R proceedings must be initiated. 
 •Successfully completes a bona fide dr ug abuse rehabilitation program;  
•Demonstrates complete n on-associat ion with dangerous drugs for a 
minimum of 6 months after completion  of the rehabilitation program; and 
•Is actively participating in a bona fide drug monitoring program, which 
incorporates random unannounced chemical testing. 
C.15.i.2.  Return Where Alcohol Use/Abuse Was Cause Of 
Incompetence 
Where the v oluntary deposit is based on incompetence due to alcohol use/abuse, 
the deposit agreement shall provide that the MM Cs will not be returned until the 
mariner:  
•Successfully completes a bona fide alc ohol abuse rehabilitation program; and 
•Is actively participating in a bona fide support group. 
C.15.j.  Acceptance Of Medical Reports 
A medical report indicating that a ma riner is fit for duty need not be accep ted 
without ques tion.  The designation of fit for duty requires a careful evaluation 
balancing the mariner's past medical hi story, his/her current physical/mental 
condition, and future medical outlook against the mariner’s ability to live and 
perform safely in a shipboard environment.  In some instances , IOs may reasonably 
conduct this evaluation, and the depos ited MMCs may be retur ned to the m ariner.  
IOs may con sult with the physician attestin g to the mariner’s fitness concern ing a 
mariner's prior medical history and shipboard duties for this purpose.  Prior t o 
releasing the medical history to the ph ysician, the consent of th e mariner shall be 
obtained.  In certain insta nces, howev er, a proper evaluation wi ll be considered to be 
beyond the s cope of an IO's expertise and discretion.  These instances inclu de cases 
involving:  
•Convulsive disorders, suc h as epilepsy;
•Psychiatric illnesses; and  
•Complicated  or conflicting medical data in which th e mariner's a bility to live 
and perform safely in a shipboard environment is unclear to IOs .
C.16.GOOD-FAITH 
DEPOSITSIn such instances, and wh enever IOs desire, the ma riner's medical history, along 
with pertinent physician's evaluation, and the IO/ OCMI case remarks shall be 
forwarded to Commandant (CG-5451) who will request a determination from the 
Chief of the Medical Branch at th e Nationa l Maritime Center.  If it is determined 
that th e mariner is permanently not fit for sea duty, the MMC shall be returned and a 
complaint for incompetence shall be i ssued. 
Mariners may make a "good-faith" deposit of his/her MMC(s) to IOs cond ucting an 
investigation, when the m ariner desires that  any acti on be taken at a different port, 
 C.17.VOLUNTARY 
SURRENDER46 CFR 5.203 contains provisions for volu ntary surrender of MMCs in lieu of a 
hearing to answer a comp laint.  Before agreeing to accept volun tarily surrendered 
MMCs, IOs shall ensure that the m ariner is:  
•Shown a cop y of the com plaint, and informed the a bility to request a time 
and place for a hearing before an ALJ;  
•Advised of the right to counsel at the hearing; and  
•Informed of the possible consequences, favorable and unfavorable, of a 
hearing.  or when the mariner requests a delay f or any reaso n and the IO  agrees.  This process 
ensures the mariner's ap pearance a t another time or place.  IOs should agree to a 
change of date or location only if satisfied that it will not prejudice the government's 
position.  Before agreeing to a change IOs should consider the availability of 
witnesses an d the reliability of docum entary evidence.  Transfer of jurisdiction 
strictly for the convenience of the mariner should be done only i f the mariner is 
willing to make a good-faith deposit; otherw ise, a complaint should be issued.  In 
cases for which there is evidence of misconduct, when the mari ner requests that th e 
case be transferred to another CG unit, IO s should issue a complaint; at the i nitial 
hearing, the mariner can request a cha nge of venue (location) from the ALJ.  The 
ALJ can so order, provide d that change of venue will not adversely affect the 
government's case and is not requested solely for purposes of delay.  In cases when 
the sailing of a vessel precludes immediate conveni ng of a hearing, subpoenas 
should not be issued to compel attendance.  Rather, the investigative file should be 
forwarded to the OCMI a t the port of destin ation, with a reques t for an IO to meet 
the vessel.  A good-faith deposit shall not be accepted from a mariner who must 
continue to s erve under his/her MMC(s) in order to meet th e vessel's obligations or 
if the mariner is attempti ng to complete an  alcohol /drug rehabilitation program.  A 
written agreement ma y be executed on  Form CG-2639I, in duplicate.  Both copies 
shall be signed in ink by the mariner, the IO, and a ny witnesses.   A copy shal l be 
given to the mariner and the other co py maintained in the unit case file.  The unit 
copy of the form shall be scanned and a ttach ed to the MISLE enforcement activity 
as correspondence.  IOs s hall notify NMC via the notify NMC function in the 
MISLE Enforcement Activity requesting that the mariner’s record be locked while 
the MMC is on deposit.  Form CG-2639I is availab le within the investigations 
community of CG Central and in the CG electroni c forms library. 
Before accep ting a voluntary surrender of a MMC for any act or  offense, IOs should 
inform the mariner that a voluntary surrender is equivalent to a revocation;  the only 
means for the mariner to be allowed to apply for a new MMC is through the 
administrative clemen cy process (see 4 6 CFR 5.901).  [NOTE: The Comma ndant 
reserves the right to return any MMCs which have been volunta rily surrendered.]  
IOs shall ensure that the mariner understands the rights and the consequen ces 
indicated ab ove before entering into a vo luntary surrender agr eement.  A written 
agreement m ay be execu ted on Form CG-2639E, in duplicate.  Both copies shall be 
signed in ink by the mari ner, the IO, and any witn esses.  A cop y shall be given to the

was destroyed or clearly defaced as voi d/invalid (fo r cases involving possible
criminal charges for forgery).  Form CG-2639E is available within the investi gations 
community of CG Central and in the CG electroni c forms library. 
D.DEFAULTS
The default process replaced the in absentia  hearing in the S&R process. 
IOs may file a default motion if the responden t fails to file a timely answer to the 
complaint wi thout a showing of good cause for not timely answering the complaint.  
If an answer from the respondent is n ot received within 25 days of serving the 
complaint, IOs should contact the Docketi ng Center.  If the respondent has not 
filed an answer, the clerk will supply a certi ficate of answer attesting that no answer 
was filed. 
IOs must file a motion to obtain a default order.  The motion m ust conform to the 
requirements of 33 CFR 20.302 (Filing of Documents), 20.303 (Form and Content) 
and 20.304 ( Service).  The motion mu st also include a proposed  decision.  A default 
motion temp late is availab le within the inve stigations community of CG Central.  
IOs must file the motion with the Do cketing Center, file a copy with the ALJ 
assigned to the case (if an  ALJ has been assigned), and serve a copy on the 
respondent.  IOs must serve a copy on the respond ent in person, via certified mail 
or by express-courier service that has receipt capability ( i.e. FedEx, DHL, etc.).  IOs 
must also include proof of service of the complaint with the mo tion for default.  If 
the complain t was served in person, the certificate of service for the compla int 
should be submitted as p roof of service. 
Until MISLE requires electronic filing of th e motion with the Docketing Center, 
IOs must submit a certificate of service wh en filing the motion with the Docketing 
Center.  Except in the cas e of personal service, the certificate of service does not

E.1.INTRODUCTIONshow proof of service.  Once proof of serv ice is obtained IOs must file a return of 
service document with th e Docketing Center  that contains the proof of service of 
the motion.
Upon findin g the respondent in defau lt, the ALJ issues a decisi on against the 
respondent.  If the ALJ finds that the re spondent had good cause not to answer or 
appear, the ALJ will set aside the finding of defa ult. 
With relaxed service rules it is likely that defaults wi ll be set aside (purged) if a 
respondent can establish that he/she wa s at sea or otherwise unavailable for 
legitimate reasons.  Respondents can file a motion or a petition to reopen or  set 
aside the def ault order at any time.  If the respondent demonstr ates good cause, the 
default may be set aside.  The decision to set aside a default is solely at the ALJ’s 
discretion.  If IOs believes that the res pondent deli berately avoi ded service, IOs 
should oppose the motion or petition.  Otherwise, the respondent should be given 
an opportunity to be hear d. 
If a respondent fails to appear at a hear ing or conference, IOs may make a motion 
with the ALJ requesting that the ALJ enter a defau lt against a respondent.  The ALJ 
will issue an order to show cause why a default should not be entered.  The 
respondent has 30 days to establish good  cause for his/her failure to appear. 
A complaint will be automatically dismi ssed without prejudice 90 days after the 
answer period expires if an answer or default motion is not filed with the D ocketing 
Center.  If this happens IOs will need to  reissue the complaint to the respondent. 
E.SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS
A settlement agreement is  designed to expe dite the administrative hearing process, 
not by pass i t.  In a hearing, the ALJ ca n only imp ose sanction s against the MMCs.  
A settlement agreement a llows IOs to impose remedial actions such as specific 
training, or requirements for cure.  IOs should review the case prior to making a 
decision on the use of a settlement agreement.  If the MMC(s) a re to be susp ended 
or revoked, the respondent shall deposit his/her MMC(s) with the Coast Gu ard 
prior to signing the settlement agreem ent.  Settlem ent agreements must not require 
routine reports or submissions to the ALJ during the settlem ent period.  If IOs 
wants to revi ew the respo ndent’s reports at regular intervals during the settlement 
period, the settlement agreement shou ld spell out those requirements.  Ultimately, it 
is the respondent’s responsibility to demonstrate s uccessful completion of the terms 
of the agreement.  A settlement agreement shall n ot be used when a compl aint for 
professional incompeten ce is issued.  Additi onally, if an investigation indicates there 
was intentio nal misconduct or negligence th at cau sed serious injury, death, major 
damage to pr operty, or significant environmental d amage, a settlement agreement 
should not be used.  Questions concerning  the proper use of settlemen t agreements 
 E.2.REGULATIONS The regulations concerni ng settlemen t agreements  can be foun d at: 
•Conferences; 33 CFR 20.501 
•Settlemen ts; 33 CFR 20.502 
E.3.WHEN TO 
FILE SETTLEMENT 
AGREEMENTSIOs can file a settlem ent agreem ent at anytime after the compla int is filed.  It can be 
filed with the complaint.  If filing the settlement agreement with the complain t, 
ensure the respondent does not also file an  answer.   If filing a se ttlement agreement 
before an ALJ is assigned, the Docketing Center will assign an ALJ and send the 
settlemen t file to the ALJ’s office.  After an ALJ is assigned, parties should file 
settlemen t agreements dir ectly with th e assigned ALJ. 
E.4.SETTLEMENT 
TYPESIn general, a settlemen t agreement allo ws IOs to im pose remedi al actions su ch as 
specific training, allows for the proof of cure of drug or alcohol use/addiction, or 
allows IOs to offer a mitigated sanction to  mariners that have been cooperative and 
do not require remedial actions.  Settlem ent agreem ent templ ates are available in 
MISLE and within the in vestigations community of CG Central.  
E.4.a.  Drug Use/Addiction should be addressed to C ommandant (CG-5451). 
Mariners that have had no previous complaints for drug use/a ddiction proved, or 
who have no t previously voluntarily deposited or surrendered their MMC(s) due to 
drug use/addiction may be offered a settlem ent agreement allo wing them to prove 
cure.  A mariner that has previously succe ssfully co mpleted th e cure requirements 
shall only be offered a settlement to pr ove cu re again, if it has been at least 3 years 
from the completion of the cure requireme nts and a Substance Abuse Professional 
(SAP), meeti ng the requirements of 49 CFR 40.281 or a Medical Review Officer 
(MRO), meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 40.121, has determined that the 
mariner is still a viable candidate for cure .  If the mariner does not meet the above 
or if the positive chemical  test was the re sult of require SMI testing IOs shall not 
offer a settlement and sh ould instead take th e case to a hearing seeking revocation.  
The mariner must admit to the jurisdictional and factual allegati ons of the co mplaint.  
To ensure a nationally co nsistent appr oach to dealing with drug users, the drug 
settlemen t agreement tem plate approv ed by CG-5451 and available within th e 
investigations community of CG Central and in MISLE shall be used.  This standard 
agreement requires the respondent to provid e proof of cure as defined in CDOA 
2535 (SWEENEY), CDOA 2634 (BARRETTA) and CDOA 2 638 
(PASQUARELLA).  The settlemen t agreemen t states that the MMC(s) are revoked, 
but that the r evocation is stayed to allow the respon dent to es tablish cure.  The 
settlemen t agreement es tablishes a deadline for the respondent to enroll in, and 
 E.4.a.1.  Amending Standard Drug Use Settlement 
Agreement 
E.4.b.  Drug Conviction and Misconduct for Use, 
Possession, or Association successfully complete an accredited dr ug rehabilitation program and provides that 
the stayed sanction of revocation take s effect immediately upon notice of non-
compliance by IOs to th e Docketing Center.  IOs shall require that th e resp ondent 
provide a minimum of 12 (this may be increa se by IOs if the particulars of the case 
warrant) random, unannounced drug tests during the 1-year non-association period 
that commences after successful completion of the rehabilitation program, to be 
spread reasonably throughout the year , that are con ducted in accordance with
Department of Transportation proced ures found in Title 49, C ode of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), Part 40.  The respondent shall b e required to attend a sub stance 
abuse monitoring progra m (such as AA/NA) for a minimum period of one-year 
following su ccessful completion of the drug rehabilitation program.  At a minimum, 
the respondent should be required to attend at l east 2 meetings a month, this may be 
increased by IOs if the particulars of the case warrant.  The res pondent is al so 
required to obtain and file a copy of a l etter from a MRO attesti ng that mariner is 
drug-free and that th e risk of subsequent use of dangerous drugs is sufficiently low 
to justify the mariner’s return to work.  If a respondent fails a drug test while 
completing the rehabilitation program  and requests that th e time to complete the 
program be extended, IO s may extend  the de adline subject to th e provisions of E.5 
below.  The MRO must concur with the assessment that the respondent is still a 
viable candidate for rehabilitation.  If a respondent fails one of the random drug 
tests required during the 1-year non-associat ion period, IOs shall file a notice of 
failure to complete.  If the respondent successfully completes all  the requirements of 
the settl ement agreement, the order will be modifie d to reflect that the MM C(s) was 
suspended outright for th e period of deposit.  The length of the suspension will be 
the time req uired to complete the dru g rehabilitation program and the mandatory 1-
year non-association period required after completion of the rehabilitation program 
(typically 13 – 15 months). 
Mariner’s that have compl eted an accredited drug rehabilitation program befo re a 
complaint has been issued  or a settlement agreement offered should be given credit 
for the completion of rehabilitation.  The drug use settlement agreement should be 
modified to reflect that th e parties ag ree that the Respondent has successfully 
completed an accredited rehabilitation prog ram.  The mariner shall be required to 
demonstrate 1-year of non-association with  dangerous drugs and their MMC(s) shall 
be in the Coast Guard’s possession during the 1 year period.  All drug use 
settlemen ts must include the requirement  for the Respondent to deposit hi s/her 
MMC(s) for a minimum of 1 year to demonstrate non-association.  
Settlemen t agreements may be offered to respondents convicted of drug related 
offense(s) and those issued a complaint for misconduct for use, possession, or 
association with dangerous drugs that m eet th e provisions of Sections B.9.b and 
 E.4.c.  Alcohol Use/Addiction 
Settlement agreements may be offered to respondents who are willing to admit to 
the jurisdiction and factu al allegations of the comp laint and desi re to seek treatment 
for their alcohol related problems.  If the alcohol us e/addiction was discovered as 
the result of post casualty testing, IOs shall not offer a settlem ent and should instead 
take the case to a hearing seeking revoca tion.  The following conditions shall be 
required of the respondent: 
•Completion of a state or local governme nt licensed or recognized alcohol 
rehabilitation program; and 
•Participation in AA meeti ngs for a one -year-period after completion of the 
rehabilitation program, at a minimum of two meeti ngs per month. 
E.4.d.  Mitigated Sanction With Conditions 
E.4.e.  Mitigated Sanction B.9.d respectfully with the exception of being able to demonstra te cure.  If the 
respondent i s shown by a recent evalu ation of a SAP, meeting the requirements of 
49 CFR 40.281, or a MRO, meeting the re quirements of 49 CFR 40.121, or by other 
evidence to be a user of, or addicted to , dangerous drugs, the standard drug 
settlemen t agreement shal l be used.  If the respondent is shown by a recen t 
evaluation of a SAP, meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 40.281, or a MRO ,
meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 40.121 , to not be a user of, or addicted to, 
dangerous drugs, then the standard drug settlemen t agreement shall be amended by 
removing the requiremen t to enroll in and successf ully complete a drug 
rehabilitation program and reducing the minimum number of random drug tests to 
6 during the 1-year non-association period.  All other conditions of the stand ard 
drug settlement agreement shall apply. 
Proof may be provided by submitting attendan ce records, certificates of 
achievemen t, or certification from his/ her sponsor attesting to attendan ce an d 
participation  in support group meetin gs.  The sanction for failure to comply with the 
above conditions should be revocation. 
IOs may offer a mitigated sanction with condition s to mariners that have b een 
cooperative during the investigation and ha ve mad e a good faith effort to reach 
compliance, but would benefit from addi tional remedial actions.  Any remedia l
action propo sed should be designed to correct the cause of the misconduct or 
negligence.  Remedial trai ning relating to the incident; and/or therapy or 
professional counseling.  The settlem ent agreement shall have a table tha t lists the 
appropriate orders for compliance and non-compliance with the terms of the 
agreement.  The sanction for non-comp liance should match the proposed order 
from the complaint. 
IOs may offer a mitigated sanction to marine rs that have been cooperative d uring

Duly subpoenaed witness es, other than Fe deral government employees may request 
payment for their attend ance by subm itting Standard Form 1157.  The party that 
called the witness must pay witness fees.  Fees and allowances will be paid as 
provided by 28 USC 1821, except tha t an expert witness may b e paid a higher fee to 
be fixed by the District C ommander.  The unit shall request funding from th eir 
servicing Area, MLC or D istrict legal o ffice for paying all fees for witnesses 
subpoenaed by IOs.  If funding is not available, the unit is responsible for paying the 
witness fees. 
IOs should attempt to anticipate the s equence of events in the h earing.  IOs should 
interview witnesses beforehand to evaluate the inf ormation that they will give under 
oath.  The names, addres ses, and tele phone numbers of potential witnesses who 
were not subpoenaed previously should be readily  available.  If, during the course of 
the hearing, testimony from such persons is necess ary, IOs may request a 
continuance of the hearing and i ssuance of subpoenas from the ALJ. 
46 USC 7702(d) authorizes the Coast Guard to temporarily suspend and take 
possession of a mariner’s MMC(s) for up to 45 days.  If this occurs, a hearing must 
be held withi n 30 days of the temporary suspension (i.e., CG taking possessio n of 
the MMC).  The regulations that cov er expedited hearings can be found in 33 CFR 
Part 20 (1201 – 1209).  IOs must file the temporary suspension complaint with the 
Docketing Center immed iately after it is served on the respondent.  The rules for

STATEMENTSF.9.a.  By the IO Any issues that remain in dispute af ter the pre-hearing conference will be 
adjudicated a t a hearing conducted un der Subpart G of 33 CFR 20. 
The Commandant has long stressed the reme dial nature of the hearing; thus, a 
balance of dignity and informality is desirable.  Coast Guard personnel shall be 
attired in the uniform of the day and s hall conduct themselves i n an appropriate 
manner at all  times.  The ALJ may ann ounce any sp ecial instructi ons for the hearing.
Since a complaint is typically issued against all MMCs issued to a mariner, the 
respondent must understand the requi rement  to bri ng all of his/her MMCs to the 
hearing.  Failure to produce them will dela y the orderly procedure of the hearing.  
For the record, the respondent shall be asked whether he/she has produced all 
MMCs that have been iss ued to him/ her.  Outstan ding MMCs shall be produced 
prior to conclusion of the hearing or otherwise accounted for. 
If, at any point during the hearing, IOs determine that a compla int has been 
incorrectly issued to a mariner or that the complain t or factual allegation(s) h as no 
basis, IOs shall move to dismiss the co mplaint/factual allegation, with or without 
prejudice.  Dismissal with prejudice mean s that the respondent may not be i ssued a 
complaint ag ain for that offense; dismissal without prejudice means that th e 
respondent may be issued a complaint again for that offense at a later date.  If it is 
determined that an offense was com mitted, but th e complaint was incorrectly 
drafted or served, IOs sh ould request di smissal without prejudice and issue a new 
complaint. 
The ALJ may, on his or her own moti on or the motion of the Coast Guard or 
respondent, permit the amendment of the complai nt and factual allegations to 
correct mino r errors by deletion or substitution of words or figures, provided that a 
legally sufficient factual al legation remains.   When errors of substance are found in

factual allegation dismissed with or wit hout prejudice.  If dismissed without 
prejudice, IOs may th en prepare and serv e a new complaint/fa ctual allegati on on the 
respondent. 
If the respondent denies the complaint and allegations, IOs shall make a statement 
outlining the matters th ey expect to pr ove, including any relevant details tha t may 
not have been captured in the factual allegations.  IOs should explain his/her theory 
of the case, the elements of the offens e, and the ev idence that will prove each 
element.  If the respondent changes hi s answer and  admits to the complaint and

The respondent or the respondent's counsel will have an opportunity to state the 
respondent's  side of the case; this opportunity may be waived or deferred.  If the 
respondent changes his answer and ad mits to the complaint and allegations the 
respondent or respondent’s counsel may present evidence or make a statement 
regarding mitigating circumstances tha t he/she  believes to be m aterial.  Should this 
evidence or statem ent be i nconsistent with an answer of admit, the ALJ must reject 
the answer, change it to d eny and proceed with th e hearing. 
F.10.EVIDENCE
F.10.a.  Prima Facie Evidence allegations, the opening statement need  only summarize the evi dence upon which 
the complain t and factual allegations were based. 
Whether issuing a complaint against a mari ner for actual or presumed negligence, 
IOs should briefly, but clearly, outline in the openin g statement the basis for the 
Coast Guard 's determination that the r espond ent's acts or decisi ons were neg ligent; 
the nature of  the applicab le standard o f care by whi ch the respo ndent's a ction were 
measured; and the exact nature  of the evidence which will be presented to prove the 
allegation.  The importan ce of this initial step in th e hearing can not be 
overemphasized.  It affords IOs the firs t and best opportunity to focus the ALJ's 
attention on the exact iss ues the Coas t Guard feels are pertinen t and to begi n 
establishing the validity of the Coast G uard's case. 
33 CFR 20, Subpart H (20.80 1 – 809) contains the rules for evidence in a S& R 
hearing.  See also Chapter  B3 of this manual for a discussion of evidence.  IOs and 
respondents may present their case or  defense by oral, documentary, or 
demonstrativ e evidence; s ubmit rebutt al evidence; and conduct any cross-
examination that ma y be necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.  
Hearsay evid ence is admi ssible in S&R proceedings; the ALJ will consider the fact 
that evidence is hearsay when determining its probative value.  One difference 
between the old evidence rules in 46 CFR Pa rt 5 and the rules in 33 CFR Part 20 is 
the limitation on the ad missibility of admissions  made by a R espondent.  The rule is 
now limited only to casua lty investigations  conducted under 46 CFR Part 4.  The 
exception for impeaching the credibility of the respondent’s evidence still applies.  
Admissions made during all personnel action inves tigations are now admissible.  See
33 CFR 20.1311 
Prima facie evidence is th at which is s ufficient on its face to es tablish a fact as 
alleged.  For example, an official logbook entry concerning an offense enumerated in 
46 USC 11501, made in substantial comp liance with 46 USC 11502 will establish, 
prima facie, the facts it co ntains.  A prima facie case, by contrast,  is a collectio n of 
evidence tha t is sufficient for a finding that a factua l allegation is proved.  However, 
it is subject to rebuttal by the defense,  after which the ALJ must decide wh ether to 
 F.10.b.  Standard Of Care in Negligence Cases 
F.10.c.  Presumption of Drug Use 
46 CFR 16.201(b) establis hes a presumption that an  individual who test positi ve in a 
drug test conducting under Part 16 will be presumed to be a user of dangero us 
drugs.  IOs, in order to estab lish the pr esumption, must prove: 
•That the res pondent was  the individual who was tested for dangerous drugs; 
•That the res pondent failed the test; and 
•That the test was conducted in accord ance with Pa rt 16. 
F.11.OFFICIAL 
MARINE RECORDS
F.11.a.  Shipping Articles, Form CG-705A, 735T, Or 
Equivalent believe all the evidence of the prima facie case.  An official logbook entry d oes not 
establish a prima facie cas e unless it co ntains  every element of the factual all egation.  
IOs have the burden of proving the case by a prep onderance of  the evidence [ See
CDOA 2472 (GARDNER)]. 
IOs may esta blish an applicable standa rd of care in several ways.   These include, but 
are not limited to, submission of expert witness tes timony concerning prudent 
marine practi ces; reference to existing laws or regulations such a s the Navigation 
Rules or navigation safety regulations wh ich require specific acts under various 
conditions; reference to existing CDOAs which ad dress prudent marine pra ctices; 
reference to other well known publications which a ddress the subject such as ; 
Griffin On Collision, K night's Modern Seamanship, Tug, Tow  and Pilotage, and 
United States Coast Pilots. 
This proof establishes a p rime facie ca se of use of a dangerous drug and shifts the 
burden of going forward with evidence to the resp ondent to rebut this presumption.  
In considering the proof of all the above elements, it should be kept in mind that 
minor techni cal infractions of the regulati ons do no t violate due process unless the 
infraction breaches th e chain of custody or violations the speci men’s integrity.  If the 
respondent produces no evidence in rebuttal,  the ALJ may find the complaint of use 
of a dangerous drug proved on the basi s of the presumption alone.  See CDOA 
2603 (HACKSTAFF), 2 592 (MASON), 2584 (S HAKESPEARE), 2560 
(CLIFTON), 2555 (LAVALLAIS), 23 79 (DRUM) and 2279 (LEWIS). 
IOs, the Coa st Guard representative, a ny other co mmissioned officer of the Coast 
Guard, or any official custodian of extra cts from shipping articles, logbooks, or 
records in the custody of the Coast G uard ma y authenticate an d certify the extracts.  
Authenticati on and certification must include a statement th at the person 
authenticatin g the record has seen the or iginal, compared the co py with it, an d 
found the copy to be a true one.  This person shall sign his/her name and id entify 
himself/herself by rank or title and by duty station.
These consti tute the contractual agreement between the master and member s of the 
crew; 46 USC 10302 sets forth the pa rticulars to be included for foreign or

voyage, they are referred to as "foreign" articles; wh en the vessel  is engaged on a 
coastwise vo yage, they ar e called "co astwise" articl es. 
Under 46 US C 11301, vessels making foreig n and intercoastal vo yages are req uired 
to have an "Official Logbook" and to make certain entries in them.  Logbook entries 
may be introduced at hearings.  Those  concerning offenses listed in 46 USC 11501 
and made in accordance with 46 USC 11502  may constitute pri ma facie evidence of 
the facts they recite.  Official logbook entries concerning offenses that are not 
enumerated i n 46 USC 11501 do not constitute pri ma facie evidence.  Never theless, 
if the entry is made in sub stantial com pliance with 46 USC 11502, it is admissible 
and may receive added weight from the ALJ.  [NOTE: If logbo ok entries are relied 
upon to prove a factual allegation, they should be examined carefully to ensure that 
they recite su fficient facts to prove all matters alleg ed.  The bare conclusion, even in 
a logbook, that the mariner committed a certain offense, is not sufficient.]  
Photocopies shall be certi fied on the reverse side a s in the following example: "I 
hereby certif y that I have seen the origin al logbook and that the obverse of this 
sheet is true and correct copy of page 47, book  I, the Official Logbook of the (vessel 
name), for the voyage co mmencing February 1, 1994 [dated an d signed by the IO, 
including rank and duty station]."  When the extra cts are typewritten, only th ose 
entries pertin ent to th e case need be extracted.  They shall be certified as in the 
following example: "I hereby certify th at I have exa mined the O fficial Logbook, 
compared th e above extr act with it, a nd found it to be a true a nd correct copy of all 
entries pertai ning to [name] on page 17 , book II of the Official Logbook of the 
(vessel name) for the voyage commencing June 31,  1995 [dated and signed by the 
IO, including rank and duty station]." 
Deck logs, weather logs, engineroom logs, and etc., may be intr oduced as ev idence.  
The ALJ may admit any r elevant oral, do cumentary, or demonstrative evidence, 
unless privileged.  Relevant evidence i s evidence tending to make the existence of 
any material fact more probable or less probable th an it would b e without th e 
evidence. 
An official record or document of a foreign country may be evidenced by an
authenticated copy, sum mary, or excerpt, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 
902(3).  That Rule provid es that foreign r ecords may be authenti cated by a certificate 
made by a s ecretary of an embassy or l egation, a consul general, consul, vice consul, 
or consular agent of the U.S. and authentica ted by the seal of that person's  office.  A 
foreign official, so authorized by th e laws of that official's country may also 
authenticate his or her country's docu ments.  In m any cases, pr operly authenticated 
foreign records of court actions, hospitalizat ions, etc., are important evidence.  Prior 
to the hearing, IOs should make every reasonable effort to obtain such records.

EXAMINATION OF 
WITNESSES. 
F.14.a.  Preliminary Examination 
F.14.b.  Direct Examination Foreign reco rds must be translated, as  necessary, an d authenticated by an 
appropriate official.  Assistance m ay be obtained from the servicing District legal 
division. 
33 CFR 20.806 authorizes the ALJ to take  official notice of such matters as could 
courts, or of other facts within the specialized kno wledge of the Coast Gua rd as an 
expert body.  IOs should use this mechanism whenever appropriate to further focus 
the ALJ's attention on ar eas of relevant interest, whether specif ied in regulation or 
not. 
33 CFR 20.808 allows the ALJ to enter  into the record the written testimon y of a 
witness.  The principal requirement is that  the o ther party must be supplied with the 
testimony pr ior to the hearing and the witness mus t be made available for cross-
examination that can be written as well.   The statement must b e sworn to, or 
affirmed, under penalty o f perjury.  Such testimon y is useful for expert witnesses and 
technical wi tnesses.  It is not very useful fo r witnesses who are testifying as to what 
they saw or heard. 
Testimony at hearing sessions may be r eceived from witnesses actually presen t or 
telephonicall y from witnesses whose atten dance is not available.  Telephonic 
testimony is authorized b y 33 CFR 20.707  and ALJs have been encouraged to use 
this means to assist in achieving financial savings and judicial efficiency.  The 
specifics should be resolved via a pre- hearing conference or at a hearing session 
prior to the call being initiated.  Experience has sho wn this mea ns to be effective for 
"routine" tes timony from distant witn esses including those abo ard vessels equipped 
for voice communications via satellite.   Telephone testimony becomes more 
complicated when compl ex legal issues and/or exhibits are involved.  The fo llowing 
examination procedures a pply whether  witn esses ar e present or their testimo ny is 
taken via telephone. 
IOs have the burden of establishing a prima facie case by the introduction of 
testimony of  witnesses an d documenta ry evidence (such as excer pts from Official 
Logbooks).  When issuing subpoenas for witnesses, IOs must consider the ti me 
necessary for direct and cr oss-examination,  to conserve the time of all parties 
involved.  For example, if IOs believe th at the testimony of a single witness will 
consume most of a day, IOs should avoid summoning other witnesses for that day. 
IOs must present eviden ce from witn esses through proper questioning; IOs should 
be aware of the testimon y that can reas onably be ex pected from the Coast G uard's 
witnesses.  It is helpful to have a prepared outline of the questions that will be asked 
of each witn ess.  This enables IOs to review those questions in advance to ensure 
they are no t legally objecti onable.  In questi oning a witness, IOs must avoid "leading 
the witness "; that is, asking questions that suggest a desired answer.  Before 
 F.14.c.  Cross-Examination 
F.14.d.  Re-cross And Redirect Examination 
F.14.e.  Respondent's Rebuttal in Negligence Cases questioning a witness with respect to a docu ment to be entered into evidence, IOs 
must "lay a f oundation" by showing the do cument to the witn ess and asking if the 
witness reco gnizes it and, if so, what he/she recogn izes it to be; the documen t is 
then submitted into evidence.  If the do cument is a dmitted into evidence by the 
ALJ, IOs may thereupon question the witne ss with respect to th e document.  If 
there is an o bjection, eith er to the form of a question or to an a nswer by the witness, 
the ALJ will afford an op portunity to bot h sides to argue on the validity or non-
validity of the objections.   All factual a llegations must be proved through direct 
examination of witnesses and introduction of evidence. 
When the C oast Guard h as completed  quest ioning the witness, the defense may 
cross-examine.  The scop e of cross-examination sh ould be confined to matters 
brought up in the direct examination, although proper questions may be ask ed to 
impeach th e credibility of the witness.  As a practical matter, ho wever, respondents 
(and non-professional counsel) frequently  introduce matters not brought out in 
direct exami nation.  Although this is tec hnically im proper, it may be allowed unless 
the issue becomes so clou ded that the record is distorted or unnecessarily ex panded.  
Leading questions are proper on cross-exam ination and may be employed freely, 
except for th e purpose of eliciting new matter. 
After cross-examination, IOs may question the witness further on redirect 
examination; the respond ent may then re-c ross-exa mine.  There is no limit to the 
number of times that eith er party has to  examine a witness, alth ough parties are 
generally satisfied with a brief redirect or re-cross-examination.  However, ALJs may 
limit re-examination.  In particular, redir ect is often restricted to matters inclu ded in 
the precedin g cross-examination. 
When only a  presumption of negligence exists , IOs have the di scretion to d etermine 
whether or not a complai nt should be issued.  As previously ind icated, this decision 
should be based on a careful evaluation of all pertinent information available.  
However, if a complaint i s issued and the respondent presents evidence at a hearing 
concerning his version of events, IOs should  be ready to rebut that evidence.   IOs 
should not rely on the ALJ to announce du ring the hearing whether the respondent 
has provided a "credible, no-fault explanati on" for his actions.  IOs should therefore 
expect as a worst-case scenario that th e ALJ will consider the presumption o f
negligence to have been r ebutted and that the burden to proceed will shift b ack to 
the Coast Guard.  At a minimum, IOs should be well prepared to strenuously cross-
examine the respondent and/or the respondent's witnesses.  Other options include 
the calling of Coast Guar d rebuttal witnesses, expert or otherwise, and the 
presentation of any additional Coast Guar d rebuttal evidence, to counter th e 
respondent's  explanation.

DISPOSITION OF

CUREThe ALJ may, at any time, question a witness to clarify the issue before the ALJ.  It 
is suggested that th e ALJ wait until bo th direct and  cross-examination are 
completed.  When both parties and the ALJ have concluded th eir examination, the 
witness should be excused.  The witne ss shall be admonished not to discuss the 
testimony, or  any matter o f which he/she  has beco me aware through the hea ring, 
with anyone until the con clusion of the hearing or unless directed to do so b y
competent a uthority. 
The testimo ny of a physician or clinical records may not be req uired in all hearings.  
When such evidence is necessary for the presenta tion of the Coast Guard's case, and 
is so ordered by the ALJ, the costs ass ociated with the examination and production 
of records or testimony will be borne by  the Coast Guard.  The respondent may 
produce med ical evidence in his/her own behalf, at his/her expense.  If the 
respondent fails, or refuses, to undergo an y such examination, the failure or refusal 
receives due weight and may be sufficient for the ALJ to infer that th e results would 
have been ad verse to the r espondent. 
For good ca use IOs or the respondent may move by making a motion to "continue" 
the hearing from day to d ay, or to adjourn the hearing to another date or loca tion.  
In ruling on this motion, the ALJ must first consider the future availability of 
witnesses an d the promp t dispatch of the vessel(s) involved.  When the resp ondent 
makes such motions, IOs should prepare to coun ter them if such an order would be 
detrimental to the Coast Guard's case.   Whe n a hearing is continued or adjourned, 
the ALJ will return all MMC(s) to the respondent upon demand, provided that a 
prima facie case has not been established that the r espondent poses a definite danger 
to the safety of life or the vessel.  In CDOA 2535 (SWEENEY ) and CDOR 18 
(CLAY ), the Commandan t determined  that wh en the Coast Gu ard proves use of an 
illegal drug, the mariner poses a threat to pu blic health, public safety, and safety of 
life at sea until he has proven he is cured.   Therefore, in drug use cases IOs should 
enter a moti on requesting the ALJ to retain the M MC(s) during the contin uance or 
adjournment.  See CDO A 2638 (PASQUARELLA). 
When an ind ividual has initiated the pr ocess of cure, but has not completely s atisfied 
the specific requirements outlined in CDOA 2535 (SWEENEY) , 2634 
(BARRETT A), and 2638 (PASQUARELLA) th e ALJ may enter a finding of proved 
and an order of revocation, but stay th is order to allow the individual to com plete 
cure.  In accordance with  46 CFR 5.70 7(a), persons who’s MMC(s) have been 
revoked as a result of dangerous drug use  are not entitled to temporary MMC(s) 
while the rev ocation is being appealed.  Similarly, persons who a re seeking a 
continuance of a hearing in order to complete cure shall not be entitled to th e use of 
their MMC(s) during the continuance and their MMC(s) shall be deposited  with the 
Coast Guard  until they ha ve met the cure re quirements.  This was first addressed in 
Commandan t Decision o n Review #1 8 (CLAY).  In that cas e, the Comman dant 
 F.17.MOTION TO 
DISMISS
F.18.RESPONDENT 
ACTIONS. 
F.19.REBUTTAL. held that once a prima faci e case of illegal drug use is  established to the satisfaction of 
the ALJ, the mariner poses a danger to pub lic safety such that su fficient cause exists 
to withhold the license or document u ntil cure is complete.  This decision 
recognized clearly that once it is proved  that the mariner used an illegal drug, the 
license or document must be revoked, or, in  the alternative, the license or document 
must be withheld until the respondent proves that he or she is cured.  This position 
was also stated in CDOA 2638 (PASQU ARELLA), which sta ted “To be cl ear on 
this issue, an ALJ cannot direct the return of  a mariner’s credentials until the mariner 
has obtained  an MRO determination in a ccordance with 46 CFR 16.201(f) and both 
steps of the SWEENEY  and CLAY  cure process have been satisfied.”  OCMI's 
shall immediately advise Commandant (CG- 5451) of any request for issuance of 
temporary M MC(s) or return of MMC(s) during a continuance that does not 
conform to this policy.   
IOs present evidence first, and then r ests th eir cas e.  At the co nclusion of the Coast 
Guard's presentation, the respondent may move  to have any or all of the offenses 
from the complaint and factual allegations dismissed on the grounds that the 
evidence fails to establish  a prima facie case agains t the respon dent.  This motion 
may be made orally durin g the hearing, or in writin g.  Usually, t his argument is a 
summation o f all of the evidence submitted by th e Coast Gua rd with the conclusion 
that th e evidence is insufficient to pro ve the offenses and factua l allegations; IOs 
may submit an oral or written rebuttal of this claim.  The ALJ may deny or grant any 
or all such motions, or may reserve a deci sion until the defense has completed its 
case.  In deci ding on the motion, the ALJ will determine if there is any substantive 
evidence tha t properly an d reasonably establishes al l essential elements of the 
offense or fa ctual allegati on in question.  If substantive evidence of the offense or 
factual allegation exists, the motion will be denied. 
The respondent's case is presented in th e same manner as the Coast Guard 's except 
that th e exa mination roles are reversed (the Co ast Guard has the right of cross-
examination).  When an attorney represents the respondent, the ALJ will usu ally 
refrain from direct involvement in th e pres entation of the defense.  In those cases 
where a resp ondent represents himself/herself, or is represented by someon e who is 
not an attorney, the ALJ may interject during  the hearing to ensure that all relevant 
facts within the witness' k nowledge are presented.  When the tes timony of th e last 
defense witness is completed, the ALJ will as k the respondent if he/she "rests"; if 
the answer is affirmative, no further testi mony will be taken for the respondent.  A 
list of common objection s and a brief description of each can be found at the end of 
this chapter.  (See Figure C4 -5: Common Witness Objections.) 
When the defense has rested, the ALJ will afford th e Coast Guard an opportunity to 
present evidence to rebu t the defense testimony.  IOs should make full use of the 
rebuttal process to further strengthen the case or i mpeach the testimony of 
witnesses, including the respondent's.  Care should be taken that this presentation is

IN MITIGATION OR 
AGGRAVATIONIOs may enter the marin er's prior disciplinary record in argument of mitigation or 
aggravation of the sancti on.  In additi on to obtaini ng a mariner's MERMARPER, 
IOs should also verify the mariner's S&R and civil penalty history in MISLE.  IOs 
may also incl ude a recom mended ord er to the ALJ .  The recom mendation can be 
amplified by calling particulars of past offe nses to the attention of the ALJ.  For 
example, a finding of "Proved" in an a ssault and ba ttery cas e may be argued to be 
aggravated because of the mariner's prio r record of assault and b attery, which
demonstrates a tendency for repeated viol ence.  IOs may also offer evidence of 
other matters in aggravation such as a pilo t's disciplinary record with a state pilot 
commission.  In accordan ce with 33 C FR 20.1 315, IOs may also  enter as part of the 
mariner’s prior record, information concerning the following: 
•Any written warning issued by the Co ast Guard an d accepted b y the 
respondent; 
•Final agency action by th e Coast Guar d on any S&R proceedin g in which a 
sanction or consent order was entered;
•Any agreement for voluntary surrender entered into  by the respo ndent; 
•Any final judgments of convictions in State or Federal courts; 
•Final agency action resulti ng in civ il penalty or warning being im posed

The order will normally apply to all licenses, certificates, and/or documents,  except 
that in cas es of negligence or professi onal incomp etence, the o rder may be directed

should be described in terms of specified time peri ods, not specific dates.  See 46

respondent to surrender his/her license, certificate and/or document immediately 
upon service of the order to the Coas t Guard.  See 46 CFR 5.567(d).  Failure  to 
comply may subject the r espondent to  penalties pr escribed by 18 USC 2197.  In 
cases involving special circumstances, the surrender may be ord ered on a cer tain 
date.  See 46 CFR 5.567(d).  Note:  ALJs have the a uthority to ta ilor an order 
appropriately in cases involving seasonal activity.  See CDOA 1793 (FARIA), 1883

G.POST-HEARING PROCEDURES. 
IOs should carefully review the cas e to see if any information should be forwarded 
to other units for action, e.g. District program managers should be sent all 
information pertaining to activities under their con trol (e.g., cases involving damage 
to aids to navigation should be brought to the attention of the District aids to 
navigation branch).  IOs s hall maintain  close liaison with ALJs’s staffs to assist, as 
necessary, in assuring that D&O's are served  and that orders for outright suspension 
or revocation are complied with.  If attempts for s ervice and/or, when applicable, 
surrender is unsuccessful; IOs shall add the mariner to the MISLE Wanted List.

It is imperative for NMC to receive thi s data promp tly to preven t the possibl e 
issuance of duplicate MMCs.  When any ma riner's MMCs is suspended, surrendered 
or revoked for any reaso n and not delivered into Coast Guard  custody, this  fact 
should also appear in the notification as we ll as a statemen t as to the disposition of 
the MMC (i.e., MMC destroyed or clearly defaced as void/invalid). 
 G.4.DEPOSIT OF 
MMCS AFTER 
SUSPENSIONWhen an AL J issues an order that the MMC(s ) are to be suspending for a pe riod of 
time, the M MC(s) shall be deposited  with the cog nizant OCM I.  A receipt shall be

REVOCATION
G.6.REOPENING A 
HEARINGG.6.a.  Added Evidence. However, it is contrary to  the policy of  the Comma ndant to retu rn MMD's to 
seamen outsi de of the United States.  This policy was initiated to prevent MMD's 
from fallin g into unauthor ized hands.  [NOTE: Mariners may be shipped as 
replacemen ts at foreign ports without MMD's].  Any request for the return of 
MMD's to a foreign address shall be deni ed.  Mariners claiming that their MMCs 
have been lost may apply for duplicates during the suspension period but duplicates 
shall not be issued until the suspension expires.  The suspension period shall not 
start until duplicate MMC requests are filed with the appropriate REC.  For m ariners 
choosing not to apply for duplicate MMCs, a lost MMC affida vit shall be required in 
a form similar to Figure C4-2.  The affidavit is to be signed in the presence o f an IO 
or notarized.  The origina l shall be sca nned an atta ched to th e MISLE enforcement 
activity as correspondence. 
When an AL J issues an order of revocation, the M MC(s) shall be surrendered to the 
cognizant O CMI.  If the MMC(s) is not surrendered, IOs shall add the mari ner to 
the MISLE Wanted List.  Revoked MMCs should be held pend ing any appeal that 
may be made.  If no appeal is made or, if  an appeal made is unsuccessful, revoked 
MMCs shall be destroyed or for cases in volving po ssible criminal charges for 
forgery, the MMC shall be clearly defa ced as void/invalid and maintained in the case 
file.  If the mariner claims that his or her revoked MMCs were previously lost, 
he/she shall be required to file a lost MMC affida vit in a form similar to Figure C4-
2.  The affidavit is to be signed in the pr esence of an IO or notarized.  The original 
shall be scan ned an attached to the M ISLE enforcement a ctivity as correspo ndence. 
33 CFR 20.904(a) allows the ALJ to reopen the record if it is be lieved that any 
change in fact or law warrants it, or tha t in the public’s interest the record should be 
reopened to take added evidence.  Any par ty ma y move to reo pen the reco rd within 
30 from the closing of the record.  The mo tion to reopen must clearly state the facts 
and the grounds for the reopening request.  If the respondent files a motion to 
reopen, IOs, if opposing the motion, must file  a response, failu re to do so will waive 
 G.6.b.  Setting Aside Conviction 
33 CFR 20.904(e)(1) provides that th e respond ent may at any ti me file a peti tion to 
reopen the r ecord for the ALJ to rescind any order suspending or revoking a 
MMC(s) if the order was the result of a conviction for: 
•A violation of a da ngerous-drug law; 
•A violation of an offense that would p revent the iss uance or ren ewal of the 
license, certificate, or document; or 
•A violation of an offense described in subparagraph 205(a)(3)(A) or (B) of

or not punishment was i mposed. 
33 CFR 20.904(f) provide s that the respondent may file a motion with the 
Docketing Center within three years o f the hearing to have the hearing reopened to 
modify an order of revocation.  This a ffords the re spondent an alternative method

DECISION AND ORDER 
OF ALJDURING 
APPEAL TO 
COMMANDANTAppeal to NTSB—must be filed within 10 days of service of 
Commandant’s decision. 
The provisions in 49 CFR 825 allow appe als to th e National T ransportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) of decisions of the Comma ndant to sustain orders of suspension, 
revocation, or denial of Temporary MMCs.   A stay of the suspension or revocation 
order may be granted when the marine r is otherwise eligible for temporary 
documents while the ma riner appeals his/her case to the NTS B (see 46 CFR 5. 715).  
This permits the mariner to continue serv ice while the appeal is pending (the same 
as when an a ppeal to the Commandan t is pending). 
The appellan t may further  seek relief from an  adver se decision in the federal court.  
When a mari ner files suit in federal court seeking to have an ad verse decision 
overturned, the servicing District lega l division, Commandant (CG-5451) and 
(CG­0945) s hall be immediately notified.  Generally, mariners are required to 
exhaust all a dministrative remedies (th at is, appeal to the Comm andant and the 
NTSB) prior to filing suc h suits.  The Coast Guard is bound by the decision of the 
court in such a case. 
Subject to th e provisions of 46 CFR 5.707, temporary MMCs may be authorized 
while a mariner is appealing a decision to the Commandant.  Temporary MMCs shall 
not be authorized when the order of revocation resulted from a complaint i ssued for 
an offense enumerated i n 46 CFR 5.59.  The request shall be made in writing and 
submitted to  the ALJ wh o heard the case.  If the transcript of the hearing record has 
been forwarded to the C ommandant,  the request shall be forwarded to 
Commandan t (CG-5451).  If the ALJ denies  the request, the in dividual may appeal, 
within 30 days of the ALJ’s notification of the denial, to Commandant (CG- 5451).  
The Coast Guard official (ALJ or CG-5451)  taking action on the request mus t take 
into consideration wheth er the service of the individual is compatible with th e 
requirements for safety at sea and cons istent with a pplicable laws.  Depending on 
the circumstances, the in dividual, for safety reason s, may only b e permitted to serve 
in a lesser ca pacity th an their regular li cense would otherwise au thorize.  The 
temporary license is distinct from the regular license.  [See CD OA 2483 
(TOMBARI)].  After auth orization by the ALJ or the Comman dant, tempor ary 
MMCs may be issued by the National Mari time Center (NMC) and the individual 
must meet a ny additional  requirements deem ed necessary by th e NMC.  Temporary 
MMCs are valid for a period not to ex ceed 6 months.  Where the appeal pr ocess 
exceeds this period, the mariner may reque st renewal of any temporary MMCs by 
filing a request for extension with the Co mmandant (CG-5451).  When granted, the 
expired MMCs shall be surrendered an d a replacement issued for the period 
authorized.  At the time of issuan ce, the previously issued MMCs shall be 
surrendered to the issuing REC or NM C and forwarded to Commandant (CG-0941) 
for inclusion  in the appeal file.  A temporary MMD shall be issued in the format 
shown in Figure C4-3.  To allow the mariner to post the licens e in a conspi cuous

APPEAL. place, as required by 46 USC 7110, the temporar y license is issued on Form CG-
2849, License to U.S. Merchant Marine Officer.  The face of th e license is 
completed in  the same ma nner as is an original, and is signed and dated by the 
OCMI or the OCMI's representative,  with the following modification to be placed 
above the signature block: "Temporary License issued under 46 CFR 5.707, t o 
expire six m onths from date of issue.  This License replaces License Number 
123456 issue d at (PORT) on (DATE)."  If the final decision on the appeal upholds 
the original order to suspend or revoke the mariner's MMCs, all temporary MMCs 
must be surrendered immediately.  If the original MMC will expire in less than 6 
months, the validity of the temporary MMC  is limited accordin gly.  If the 
Commandant authorizes i ssuance or renewa l of a temporary MMC but the original 
has expired, the licensee s hall apply for renewal of the original MMC before the 
temporary M MC is issued .
Subject to th e provisions of 46 CFR 5. 715, temporary MMCs may be authorized by 
the Comman dant while a mariner is appealing a decision to the NTSB.  Temporary 
licenses shall be issued as described above, and temporary MMD shall be issued in 
the format s hown in Figure C4-4.  The temporar y MMCs shall be valid for a 
maximum of 6 months (or until a decision has been reached).  If review has not 
been completed and an o rder not served by the N TSB within 6 months, the 
temporary M MCs may be renewed as d escribed above.  At the ti me of issuance, the 
previously issued MMCs shall be surrendered to the issuing REC or NMC and 
forwarded to Commanda nt (CG-0941) for inclusion in the appeal file. 
A mariner who has surrendered his/her MMC to the cognizant OCMI, and then 
appeals a decision of an ALJ to the Commandant or a decision of the Commandant 
to the NTSB , immediatel y begins serving the imposed sanction provided he/she has 
not requested a stay of the ALJ’s decision.  If a stay is granted and the issuance of a 
temporary M MC is authorized, the mar iner does not begin serving his/her sanction 
until all appeals are exhausted and, if issued, the temporary MMC is surren dered to 
the issuing OCMI.  See NTSB decision EM-134 ( SIMMONS).

46 CFR 5.901 -  5.905 
46 CFR 10.223
46 CFR 12.02-21Merchant mariners whose Me rchant Mariner Credential(s) (M MC) have been revoked 
or have voluntarily surrendered such MMC(s) must seek authorization to be issued a 
new MMC following the provisions of Title 46, Co de of Federal Regulations, Part 5, 
Subpart L (5.901-5.905), or 33 CFR 20.904 (f).  These regulatory provisions for 
mariners to seek authorization to be is sued a new MMC are commonly referred to as 
the administr ative clemen cy process.  See Section A.5. below for further guidance on 
the applicabi lity of each p rocess.  Adm inistrative clemency is a v oluntary process for 
merchant m ariners.  As such, the marin er has specific tasks that must be com pleted 
to ensure a favorable deci sion.  The administrative clemency process resides  solely 
under the discretion of the Office of Investigation and Casualty Analysis, 
Commandant (CG-545).  The information cont ained within this chapter will aid the 
Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCM I) in determining if the applican t:

It is the applicant’s respon sibility to provide the necessary docu mentation fo r 
administrative clemen cy regardless of the clemen cy process that applies.  When a 
mariner contacts the C oast Guard, the OCMI shall review the cl emency pro cesses 
and documentation requirements with  the mariner and provide the mariner with a 
copy of Figure C5-2, Administrative Clem ency C over Sheets, to assist the mariner in 
preparing a complete appl ication packa ge.  For application packa ges going to the 
ACRB (see A.5. below for the distinction), the ap plicant has 60 daysto submit a 
complete p ackage starting with their first documen tation submi ssion. 
OCMIs shall use the Ad ministrative Clemen cy Checklist (Figure C5-1) located at the 
end of this chapter to ens ure mariner application p ackages are complete and shall 
attach a copy of the comp leted chec klist as correspondence in the MISLE 
Administrati ve Clemency enforcemen t activity.  OCMIs must ensure that 
administrative clemen cy applicants meet those mini mum requirements prior to 
forwarding t he application package for consideration. 
In general, acting as the OCMI representati ve, it i s the IOs responsibility to provide a 
copy of the Administrati ve Clemency Cover  Sheets (Figure C5-2) to every a pplicant 
(regardless of the clemen cy process th at applies), review and verify the

B.3. MINIMUM 	 The checklis t (Figure C5-1) provides a comp lete lis t of items needed to perf ect th e 
CONTENTS administrative clemen cy application pa ckage.  The following is a list of the minimum 
documentation required: 
•	Complete an d signed application for orig inal license, certificate of registry 
and/or MMD; 
•	Letter from Applicant in cluding waiver request if applicable;  
•	Letters from employer(s) since  the revocation or surrender of the MMC; 
•	Letters of character reference; 
•	Proof o f rehabilitation or cure;  
•	FBI Criminal background and Drivers record check *; 
• Any other in formation the applicant may wish to be considered. 
*The use of NCIC/NLETS is not authorized to conduct thes e record checks. 
B.4.	TIME LIMITS In accordance with 46 CFR 5.901, the minimum wa iting period for offenses listed in 
46 CFR 5.59 and 5.61(a) is THRE E years. A revocation or surrender of a MMC for 
a mariner’s refusal to take a drug test shall be considered an offense listed in  46 CFR 
5.59 and the three-year waiting period a pplies.  All other offenses require a ONE -
year waiting period. 
B.5.	WAIVERS 46 CFR 5.901 allows for a waiver of the th ree-year  minimum waiting period.  There is 
no waiver provision for t he one-year period. All requests for a waiver of the three-
year waiting period shall be in writin g and forwarded with the a pplicant’s 
administrative clemen cy package.  The mariner’s request should explain why he or 
she feels that the three-year waiting peri od should be waived and provide ample 
documenta tion to justify their request.  IOs should advise the m ariner that th ere is no 
obligation to grant a waiver and any omissions or non-compliance with other 
minimum requirements would reduce the likelihood of the wai ver being gra nted.  
Waivers for offense described in B.5.b. an d B.5.c. below will only be granted once to 
an applicant for clemency. 
B.5.a. Good Character
The applican t must demo nstrate "Goo d Character"  within the community for a 
period exceeding three years from the date of occur rence tha t resulted in the 
surrender. For example, the mariner committed an  offense in 1989, but the 
applicant's MMC was not surrendered until 1994.  The applicant applies for clemency 
in 1995, but since three years have no t passed since the surrend er the applicant must 
seek a waiver  of the time l imitations.  If the applica nt has met th e “good character”

 A.DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROGRAM
A.1.INTRODUCTION This chapter describes and provides guid ance on the Drug and Alcohol Program; it 
does not con tain any enfo rcement guidance.  See ch apters C2, C3 and C4 for 
enforcement guidance. 
In 1988, the Coast Guard , in concert with other U . S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) m odal administrations, published regulations to prescribe the 
minimum sta ndards, procedures, and means to be used to test f or the use of 
dangerous drugs and alcohol in the marine  industry.  Title 46, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Parts 4 and 16 (46 CFR 4, 16) prescribe which com mercial vessel 
crewmemb ers are required to be chem ically tested a nd under what circumsta nces 
the testing m ust be done.  The intent o f the regulations is to provide a means  to 
minimize the use of intoxicants by merchant marine personnel and to promote a 
drug free and safe work environment by deterring the illegal use of controlled 
substances.  DOT has developed and publis hed 49 CFR Part 40 regulations that 
describe in detail how Co ast Guard-required drug tests are to be conducted.

laboratories, MROs, substance abuse professionals, and C/TPAs.  To act as service 
agents, persons and organizations mus t meet the q ualifications set forth in 
applicable sections of 49 CFR Part 40.  Service agents are not employers for 
purposes of this part and cannot act as the Designated Employer Representative 
(DER).

processes.  The DER also  receives test results and other comm unications for the 
employer, co nsistent with  the requirements of 49 CFR Part 40.  Service agents 
cannot act as  DERs. 
A.4.
APPLICABILITYA.4.a.  General 
Certain crewmembers are subject to the re gulations of 46 CFR Part 16.  If MMCs 
are required by at least one person on the vessel, th en that p erson, and possibly 
more could be subject to  the regulations based upo n their safety sensitive position 
and responsibilities on the vessel.  Each vessel must be evaluated independently 
using the definitions of "crewmember" and "operati on" to determine person-
specific applicability .  With the excep tion of serious marine incident testing 
requirements, the regulations contained in  46 CFR Part 16 are not applicable to 
foreign flag vessels or those vessels th at do not require licensed personnel.  
Examples of vessels where licensed personne l are not required (and therefore these 
regulations do not apply) are towing vessels  under 26 feet in length and com mercial 
fishing industry vessels under 200 gro ss tons. 
A.4.b.  Safety Sensitive Positions 
In addition to the licensi ng requirement for enrollment in a ch emical testin g
program, the regulations require a marine employer to establish a  chemical tes ting 
program for employees who occupy a sa fety sensiti ve position on a vessel.  
Crewmembers in a safety sensitive position include those who: 
- Occupy a position, or perform the duties and functions of a position required by 
the vessel’s Certificate of Inspection (COI); 
- Are required by law or regulation to hold a Coast Guard license to perform their 
duties; 
- Perform duties and functions directly related to th e safe operation of the vessel; 
- Perform duties and functions of watchm en or patr olmen required by Coast Guard 
regulations; or 
- Are specifically assigned the duties of warn ing, mustering, assembling, assisting, or 
 controlling the movement of passengers during em ergencies. 
A crewm ember in a safety sensitive p osition can al so include individuals employed 
as bartenders , dealers, game operators  and service personnel on vessels such as 
riverboat gambling casinos.  These individuals shall be in a USCG chemical  testing 
program if their duties include, but ar e not limited  to, directing and mustering 
passengers in emergenci es, passing out life jackets, or controlling, operating 
lifesaving/firefighting equipment. 
A.4.c.  Fishing Industry Vessels 
Personnel employed on fishing indu stry vesse ls of less than 200 gross tons are not 
subject to th e chemical testing regulations of 46 CFR 16 because these vessel s are 
not required to be operated by individual s holding a Coast Guard-issued license.  
However, th ey are subject to the pos t SMI chemical testing required by 46 CFR 
4.06.  Also, t ankermen required by 46  CFR 105 on commercial fishing vessels 
dispensing petroleum products are sub ject to the chemical testin g requirements of 
46 CFR 16 si nce they meet the defi nition of crewmember (see A.3.c. above). 
A.4.d.  Marine Employer Financial Status 
The financial status of a marine empl oyer, wh ether operating "for profit" or "not for 
profit" (i. e., charity), does not change  the requirement for chemical testing. 
A.4.e.  Employee Payment Status 
The paymen t status of an employee, whether he or she is a paid employee or serving 
as a volunteer, does not change the requirement for chemical testing if that person is 
a crewmemb er (see A.3.c.  above). 
A.4.f.  Uninspected Sailing School Vessels 
Students on board uninspected sailing school  vessels technicall y meet the d efinition 
of crewmem ber due to th eir involvement in the op eration of the vessel.  However, 
their primary purpose on board is as paying passengers, who the regulations are 
intended to protect.  Due to the instr uctional natu re of the vessel's operatio n, the 
licensed oper ator is ultimately operating the vessel.  Therefore, sailing school 
students are not subject to chemical  testing requirements of 46 CFR 16. 
A.4.g.  Cargo Handling Personnel On Unmanned Barges 
The regulations governing cargo handling (46 CFR 35-35 and 151.45-4) dictate the 
crew duty requirements for cargo transfer operations of unmanned barges.  Both 
require that a n individual with the pro per license, MMD endorsement, or letter of 
designation (for subchapter O cargoes) be  on duty to perform transfer operations.  
That individual is deemed to meet th e definition of crewmem ber and is subject to 
the testing requirements o f 46 CFR 16. 
 A.4.h.  Foreign Nationals 
Crewmembers of foreign flag vessels while  operati ng in U.S. waters are subject to 
the post SMI chemical testing require ments of 46 CFR 4.06 .  Foreign nationals who 
are employed on a U. S. flag vessel in a position which is required to undergo 
chemical testing are required to meet the requirements of 46 CFR 4.06 and 46 CFR 
Part 16. 
A.5.TESTING 
METHODOLOGYA.5.a.  Chemical Testing For Dangerous Drugs 
Chemical tes ting conducted under 46 CFR Pa rts 4 and 16 is limited to tes ting for 
five dangero us drugs or d rug classes: ma rijuana, cocaine, opiates, ampheta mines, 
and phencyclidine (PCP) only.  All dangerous drug analysis is conducted on  urine 
samples.  Urine samples collected in or der to meet the requirements of these 
regulations may not be tested for any other drugs.  If an employer wants to test for 
additional drugs, or use a differe nt cutoff level, the employer must keep such a 
program completely sep arate from the Coast Guard required p rogram, including 
separate sam ple collectio ns. 
A.5.b.  Other DOT/Federal Agency Drug Tests 
Drug test tak en under the authority of another DO T Operating Administrati on or 
another Federal Agency cannot be us ed to  satisfy the requirements for a Coast 
Guard required drug and alcohol test prog ram.  Even though all DOT Operating 
Administrati ons use the s ame drug tes ting procedures (49 CFR 40), the 
requirements of a DOT Operating Administration or Federal Agency con cerning 
when a test i s required and procedures for handling test results o ftentimes wil l
differ. 
There is one exception to this:  If a creden tialed per son or credential applica nt takes 
and passes a DOT or Federal Agency drug test within the past six months, that drug 
test result m ay be used ONLY  for meeting the drug test requirement for 
credentialing (Periodic Test). 
A.5.c.  Alcohol Testing 
The alcohol testing requirement in 46 CFR 4.06 and the alcohol  testing authorized 
in 33 CFR 95 may be co nducted usin g either blood, saliva or breath samples. 
If a blood sample is to be used, only a qualified medical person may collect the 
sample.   The blood s pecimen is to be handle d using establ ished chai n-of-
custody procedures . 
Saliva and breath tes ting devices must be  capable o f determining the presen ce of 
alcohol in a person’s system, must be use d in accor dance with the manufacturer’s 
procedures and must be currently listed on a Conforming Products List maintained 
by National Highway Traffic Safety Administ ration (NHTSA).  This testing may be 
conducted b y anyone trained to perf orm such tests .  The Coast Guard does not
mandate the use of Evidential Breath Testing devices. 
 A.6.COLLECTION 
REQUIREMENTSA.6.a.  Dangerous Drug Testing Specimens 
All dangerous drug analysis is conducted on urine specimens.  Specimen coll ection 
requirements, such as wh o may collect urine specimens, collection procedures, and 
security precautions, are found in 49 CFR 40. 
Coast Guard  personnel shall not under any circumstances, provide urine collection 
materials, or perform as the collection  site person.  Coast Guar d personnel may 
suggest local sources for those materia ls and services.  A listing of potential sites for 
post-acciden t specimen collection is available at http://homeport.uscg.mil/
Missions>Investigations>Drug and Alcohol  Program “ Drug testing Service 
Providers”.  There are ad ditional com mercial vendors available that can d o drug and 
alcohol testi ng on a short notice requ irement. 
The Department of Transportation (DOT) split s ample procedures are mandatory 
for the maritime industry.  Marine employers shall ensure the D OT split sample 
procedures a re followed.  Specimen ha ndling, analysis, and reporting requirements 
are also discussed in 49 CFR 40.  It is th e responsibility of the marine empl oyer to 
ensure that the collection  of urine sample s are cond ucted within 32 hours of a 
Serious Marine Incident (SMI) occurren ce, unless precluded by safety concerns 
directly related to the inci dent.  If safety concerns do not allow collection wi thin 32 
hours, the collection must be completed as soon as the safety co ncerns have been 
addressed.  If urine samples are not co llected withi n 32 hours of the SMI or 
immediately after the safety c oncerns have been ad dressed, the reason why must be 
documented on form CG-2692B. 
46 CFR 4.06-3(a) A.6.b.  Alcohol Testing Samples 
DOT alcoho l testing procedures in 49 CFR part 40 are NOT  applicable for the 
marine industry.  Testing for the presence of alcoh ol may be co nducted usin g blood, 
saliva or breath samples.  If a blood samp le is to be used, the sample is to be 
collected O NLY by a qualified medical pers on.  A saliva or breath test can be 
conducted b y an individual trained on how to perform the test.  The timeliness of 
testing is especially important due to the ra pid elimination of alcohol from the body.  
It is the responsibility of the marine empl oyer to ensure that the alcohol tests are 
conducted within 2 hours of a SMI occurre nce, unless precluded by safety concerns 
directly related to the inci dent.  If saf ety concerns do not allow testing within 2 
hours, the testing must be completed as soon as th e safety con cerns have been 
addressed.  Testing is not required to be conducted more than eight hours after the 
SMI and the reason why the testing wa s not conducted must be documented on 
form CG-2692B.  Whenever possible, effo rts can be made to en sure that a la w 
enforcement officer conduct the al cohol test if such testing wo uld be more timely 
than testing arranged by the marine employer , or if there is any concern tha t testing 
would not otherwise be accomplished.
A.7.LABORATORY 
ANALYSISAnalysis of drug test specimens must  be conducted at a Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration (S AMHSA) certified laboratory.  A current 
list of laboratories that m eet th e minimum standar ds to engage in urine drug testing 
for federal agencies is listed in the Fed eral Register during the first week of ev ery 
 month under  the Department of Health and Human Services category.  Federal 
Registers may be accessed at http:// www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html .  The list of 
laboratories will also be posted in the DAPI general information section of the Drug 
& Alcohol Program (DAPI) Community on CGCentral. 
A.8.EMPLOYEE 
RESPONSIBILITIESEmployees must provide a urine specimen for drug testing, and a blood or breath 
sample for alcohol testing, when directed  by their marine empl oyer or a law 
enforcement officer.  An employee cannot be compelled to sub mit to drug or 
alcohol testi ng, however a refusal to test by  an employee could  subject the i ndividual 
to suspension and revocation proceed ings an d/or civil penalty actions (see section E 
below for more info on refusals). 
B.MARINE EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES
B.1.GENERAL The marine employer is responsible for es tablishing and administering a drug and 
alcohol testi ng program for their emplo yees.  The Coast Guard  has developed a 
guide booklet to assist marine employers with complying with this requirement.  
This booklet may be viewed or downloaded at http://homeport.uscg.mil
Missions>Investigations>Drug and Alcohol  Program “Marine Employers  Drug 
Testing Guidance”.  Failure, on the pa rt of a marine employer, to implement a 
program or to conduct ch emical testin gfor dangerous drugs or for evidence of 
alcohol subjects the empl oyer to the civil penalty provisions of 46 U.S.C. Section 
2115.  33 CFR Part 27 provides the current maximum penalty which may b e
assessed and the Statu te provides that the penalty m ay be assess ed per day for each 
violation and each day of a continuing vi olation constitutes a separate violation. 
B.2.
CONFIDENTIALITYThe marine employer wil l safeguard the c onfidenti ality of the testing program and 
shall not release drug testing results or  other personal information except to the 
person who was tested, to a third party that the tes ted person s pecifies in writing, to 
the Coast Guard, the National Transporta tion Safety Board (NTSB), or upon being 
presented wi th a valid co urt order in a legal proceeding. 
B.3.EMPLOYEE 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
(EAP) The marine employer mu st establish a n Employee Assistance P rogram (EAP) that 
includes education and tr aining programs on drug use for crewmembers an d the 
employer’s supervisory personnel.  Supervisors must receive at l east 60 minutes of 
training.  The education program, at a minimum, must include the display a nd 
distribution of: 
Information on drug use/ abuse; 
The employer’s drug and alcohol policy; and 
The display of a commu nity substance abuse hot-line telephone number for 
crewmemb er assistance. 
The training program, at a mini mum, must include training on: 
The effects and consequences of drug an d alcohol use on personal health, safety and 
the work env ironment; 
The behavioral indications of drug use /abuse; and 
 The documentation of tra ining completed  by crewmembers an d the employer’s 
supervisory personnel. 
B.4.REPORTING 
POSITIVE AND NON -
NEGATIVE DRUG TESTSB.4.a.  Individuals With MMCs (Merchant Mariner 
Credentials) 
Current marine employer s, potential empl oyers and sponsoring organizations must 
make a written report to the Coast G uard of all positive drug t ests results from any 
required testing of any individual with MMCs.   Positive test resul ts must be reported 
from both the present an d prospective emplo yers.  The marine employer mu st make 
this report regardless of w hether the individual was hired or not hired, and 
regardless of whether th e position required the individual to have MMCs.  Marine 
employers and sponsoring organizations should be encouraged to also report all 
non-negative results from  any required tests and all positive results from any non-
DOT test co nducted. 
B.4.b.  Individuals Without MMCs 
Marine employers are not required to  report positive or non-negative pre-
employment or random drug test results to the Co ast Guard for persons without 
MMCs.  However, employers are prohibited fr om hiring or using these individuals 
to fill safety sensitive positions.  Positive and non-negative post-SMI require d 
chemical test results must be reported re gardless of whether or not the individual 
has MMCs. 
B.5.REPORTING A 
REFUSAL TO TEST
46 CFR 4.06-5 
49 CFR 40.191A crewm ember that hold s a MMC who refuses to provide a test sample sho uld be 
reported to the nearest C oast Guard Sector or Acti vity for action to be taken  in 
accordance with applica ble laws and regula tions.  Any crewmember that ref uses to 
provide a test sample, regardless of whether or no t they poss ess MMCs must be 
removed from safety sen sitive positions.   
A MRO report of a substituted and/or adul terated drug test specimen is considered 
a refusal to test.  If a crewmember refuses to remain at a collection site to give an 
additional specimen when directed to do so by a collection agent, it will be 
considered a refusal to test. 
Guidance on appropriate actions to take agains t individuals that refuse to test can be 
found in section E below and personnel investigation guidance can be found  in 
Chapter B.11 of this manual. 
B.6.MANAGEMENT 
INFORMATION SYSTEM 
(MIS) The marine employer mu st collect dru g and alcohol testing program data for input 
to the Mana gement Information System (MIS).  This data is co llected for ea ch 
calendar year , January 1 to Decemb er 31, and must be submitted by March 15 of the 
following year to: 
Commandan t (CG-545) 
United States Coast Guar d 
2100 Second Street, S.W. 
Washington, DC 20593-0001 
 The DOT MIS form and data can b e submitted usi ng the Internet at 
http://damis .dot.gov .  A user name and password is required for submissio n and 
can be obtained from http://homeport.uscg.mil/    Missions>Investigations>Drug 
and Alcohol Program “Using the Depa rtment of T ransportation Reporting 
Website”. 
The MIS form and its instructions are available at a ll Coast Gua rd Sectors and 
Activities, an d can be do wnloaded or printed from the world wi de web at fr om 
http://homeport.uscg.mil/    Missions>Investigations>Drug and Alcohol Program 
“DAPI Pro gram Forms”.
Instructions for completing the form can also be f ound in 46 C FR 16.500. 
Forms may be submitted  on behalf of a marine em ployer by a d rug testing 
consortium or an employer representative .  It is the employer’s responsibility to 
ensure that the data sub mitted is cor rect. 
Consortiums may submit one MIS form for their entire pool, provided a list of 
those marine employers a nd vessel identification numbers for each marine employer 
covered by the submitted  MIS form is attach ed. 
B.7.SEASONAL 
EMPLOYEESMarine employers must ensure seasonal em ployees  who do not meet one of the pre-
employmen t testing exem ptions (see C .1.a. below) are pre-employment tested  upon 
their return each season.  These emplo yees shall be included as part of the random 
testing pool during the time they are in the actual employment of the company.  If a 
marine empl oyer wants to retain an in dividual as an unpaid em ployee during the 
"off-season" and that indi vidual remains in the em ployer’s random testing p ool and 
fully participates in any required testing, he/she can be treated as a "returning" 
employee when they return to  the payroll and will not need to be pre-employment 
tested.  The same would hold true for a seam an returning to the same comp any after 
an absence (i .e. vacation o r normal time off from being part of a blue/gold crew) 
during which the seaman was still consider ed an employee of the company (i. e. still 
receiving medical and/or other benefits).  Individuals changing positions or ships 
within a com pany's fleet a re not consid ered "new hi res" and do not need to be pre-
employmen t tested. 
B.8.SHARING 
CREWMEMBERS AND 
INDEPENDENT 
MARINERSMany marine employers al low their em ployees to temporarily work for other marine 
operators.  There are also many individuals who ma ke themselves available for 
employment, particularly as deckhands  on charter b oat operatio ns.  In order to 
ensure that the chemical testing requirements are n ot compromi sed, marine 
employers who share crewmembers with a nother  employer or hire independent 
mariners must ensure tha t the ch emical testing rules are followed.  These employers 
must: 
-  Conduct pre-employment tests.  These tests can be waived if the marine employer 
determines that an individual has been in a random testing program for 60 days 
within the pr evious 185 days and has not tested po sitive or refused to take a 
chemical test.  This documentation is to be retained by each marine employer who 
hires this individual. 
-  Ensure that serious marine incident testing and reasonable cau se testing is 
 conducted o n any crewm ember when required by the regulations. 
-  Presently, there is nothing to preven t a charterbo at operator from sharing crew 
members with another operator or from hiring independent consortium members as 
long as the chemical tes ting rules are followed. 
-  Ensure that all employers of a “sha red” crewmember are ma de aware of any 
positive test or refusal to test by the cr ewmemb er. 
B.9.CHECK OF 
EMPLOYEES’ DRUG AND 
ALCOHOL TESTING 
RECORDB.9.a.  Marine Employers requesting information 
49 CFR 40.25 requires a marine empl oyer, after obtaining the employee’s (or 
potential em ployee) written consent, to request information on that individual from 
all DOT regulated emplo yers who hav e employed the individual for any time during 
the previous 2 years.  This applies only to employees  seeking to be placed in a safety 
sensitive position (i.e., a new hire, an employee tran sferred into a safety sensi tive 
position).  If the individual will not pr ovide their written consent, the marine 
employer ma y not place them in any s afety sensitiv e position.  Employers n eed to 
request the f ollowing information: 
Alcohol test with a result of  .04 or higher alcohol concentration (for marine 
employers this will be non-DOT alcohol test results and should be identified as 
such.); 
-  Verified p ositive drug t est; 
-  Refusals to be tested (in cluding veri fied adulterated or substituted drug test 
results); 
-  Other violations of DOT agency d rug and alcohol testing and/or Coast Guard 
alcohol testi ng requirements; and 
-  For employees who h ave violated a DOT drug and alcohol regulation, 
documenta tion of the em ployee’s successful completion of DO T return-to-duty 
requirements (including follow-up tests).  If the previous employer does not have 
this information, the marine employer must seek to  obtain this information from 
the employee.  If there is a DOT alcohol violation that will occur as the result of 
being employed in a safety-sensitive position regulated by another DOT modal 
administration (e.g., FAA, FMCSA).  If the alcohol violation was incurred under 
Coast Guard  authority, th e mariner must  present evidence of completing the 
requirements of their Agreement b y which they ha d their credential returned to 
them. 
-  If feasible, this information must be obtained and  reviewed before the emp loyee is 
placed into a  safety sensitive position.  If not feasible, the information should be 
obtained and  reviewed as soon as possible.  However, this individual should not fill 
a safety sensi tive position for a period of more than 30 days after the date th e 
information was requested, unless the information has been obtained or a good faith 
effort to obtain the information has b een made an d documented. 
- The employer must also  ask the emp loyee whether they have tested positiv e, or 
refused to test, on any pre-employment drug test taken in conjunction with  an 
application for a safety sensitive position, but not o btained, with in the last 2 years. 
 B.9.a.1.  Actions After Receiving Information 
If the marine employer receives informati on that the employee had violated a DOT 
agency drug and alcohol and/or a Coast Gu ard alcohol regulation, they mus t not 
use the empl oyee in safety sensitive p ositions unless they have obtained information 
that th e emp loyee has su bsequently complied with  the DOT return-to-duty 
requirements for a DOT drug test violation and co mpleted an y Coast Guard
requirement for an alcohol violation.  Also, if the employee ad mits to having had a 
positive test or a refusal to test, the em ployer may not use the employee in safety 
sensitive positions until and unless the employee d ocuments su ccessful com pletion 
of the return-to-duty requirements.  See section D.3 .a.for guidance on the D OT 
return-to-duty requirements. 
B.9.b.  Marine Employers providing information 
Marine employers who ar e requested to provide information on previous employees 
must: 
-  Ensure that they h ave received and reviewed the employee’s s pecific written 
consent (sho uld be an original signature and not a facsimile); 
-  Immediately release the requested in formation to the employer making the 
request; 
-  Ensure that the informa tion includes any of the r equested information tha t was 
obtained from their request for information from previous employers; and 
-  Release th e information in any written fo rm (e.g. fax, e-mail, letter) th at ensures 
confidentiality. 
B.10.REQUIRED 
RECORDKEEPINGB.10.a.  Positive Test Results and/or Test Refusals  
Marine employers are required to keep records of tests reported  positive or test 
refusals by the MRO for a period of 5  years. 
B.10.b.  Negative Test Results 
Marine employers are required to keep records of tests reported  as negative or 
negative-dilute for at least 1 year. 
B.10.c.  Pre-employment records 
Marine employers must have records that will demonstrate that an individual has 
passed a pre-employmen t test or has b een subject to random tes ting in support of 
the pre-empl oyment waiver requirements. 
B.10.d.  Record of all testing performed 
Marine employers must h ave test reco rds that indicate: 
The total nu mber of individuals chemically  tested a nnually for dangerous drugs in 
each of the categories of testing required; 
The number of individuals who tested posit ive and for what typ es of drugs; and 
The number of test refusals (Adulterated, substituted). 
 B.10.e.  Request for Employee Drug and Alcohol Testing 
Results 
Marine employers who have requested drug and alcohol test result information on 
employees m ust keep a wr itten, confidential record of the information obtai ned or 
the good faith effort they made to obta in the information.  These records must be 
kept for 3 years from the date the emp loyee first performed in a safety sensiti ve 
position. 
B.10.f.  Release of Employee Drug and Alcohol Testing 
Results 
Marine employers who have released drug  and alcohol test res ult information on 
employees, i n accordance with 49 CFR part 40.25, must keep a  written reco rd of the 
information released, including the date, th e party to whom it was released a nd a 
summary of the information provided. 
C.OCCASIONS TO CONDUCT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS
C.1.PRE-
EMPLOYMENTA crewm ember must pas s a chemical test fo r dangerous drugs before an employer 
may employ them.  A pro spective crewmemb er that submits a urine sample cannot 
be employed  in a safety s ensitive position until a verified negative test result i s
received by the employer.
C.1.a.  Pre-employment waivers 
An employer  may waive a  pre-employment  test if the prospecti ve employee has: 
Passed a chemical test for dangerous drugs within the previous six months with no 
subsequent positive tests or refusals to test during the remainder  of the six month 
period; or 
Been subject to random testing for 60 days within the previous 185 days and did not 
fail or refuse to participate in chemical testing for dangerous drugs.  "Being subject 
to random testing" does not mean th e individual has to have actually been tes ted, 
but has been  eligible to be tested. 
An employer  is not required to exem pt prospective employees from pre-
employmen t testing. 
C.2.PERIODIC Periodic tests are the resp onsibility of th e individual mariner, not the marine 
employer, for transaction s involving thei r MMCs.  Drug test results must be 
submitted wi th their MMC applicatio n.  The test r esults must b e completed and 
dated not m ore than 185 days prior to the submis sion of the application. 
Mariner’s that can provide satisfactory evidence tha t they h ave passed a DO T 5-
panel drug test within the previous 6 mont hs or provide evidence that during the 
previous 185 days they h ave been subject to  rando m drug testing program for at 
least 60 days and have not failed nor re fused to take any required drug test, do not 
have to sub mit drug test results with their application. 
 C.3.RANDOM Random, for purposes of the drug testing regulation, means that each crewmember 
has an equal chance of being selected each  time ra ndom selecti ons are mad e.  The 
random selection must be by a valid scient ific method.  Random drug testing shall 
be unannounced, meaning  there is no prior notice to the individual being test.  
When an ind ividual has been notified of the requirement to tak e a random d rug test, 
that individual must immediately comply with the notification to test.  If the 
individual employee does not immedi ately com ply, it can be co nsidered a refusal to 
test. 
An employee’s chance of  selection m ust continue throughout his or her 
employment.  This means that the mar ine employer  cannot allow periods when an 
employee is "free" from chance of sel ection, or allow high-risk/low-risk selection 
periods to exist.  An empl oyer may ran domly select vessels, rather than individuals, 
testing all applicable crewmembers. 
The dates of testing must also be random .  For exa mple: randomly picking names 
each payd ay is not accep table, because the date is p redictable an d the employees 
could "beat" the test. 
No other tes ts, such as post accident or pr e-employment can b e counted to ward the 
required percentage for the random test ing.  Marine employer s may form or 
otherwise us e sponsoring organizations, or  may use contractors, to conduct their 
random chemical testing program. 
C.3.a.  Annual Rate 
Commandant will publish in the Federal Re gister the minimum annual percentage 
rate for random drug testing of covered crewmemb ers.  The annual random drug 
testing rate h as been set a t 50% since 1988.  However, the annual rate may b e
adjusted bas ed on data received through Management Information System (MIS).  If 
data received  for two consecutive calendar years indicates tha t the positive rate was 
less than 1.0 %, the random drug testing rate may be reduced to 25%. 
C.3.a.1.  How To Determine The Number Of Tests 
Required 
The number of random tests conducted each  year must be based on the nu mber of 
employees employed by the marine em ployer to s erve as crewmembers, not the 
number of billets on board the employer’s  vessels.  For example; if a marine 
employer employs 12 crewmembers throughout a year to fill 6 crewmember billets 
on board their vessel, the number of random tests r equired would be based on 12 
employees.  Thus, using a required rate of 50%, 6 random tests  would need to be 
conducted d uring that year. 
C.3.b.  Program Requirements for inspected vessels 
A marine em ployer must establish a program for ra ndom drug testing of 
crewmemb ers on inspected vessels who:  
-  Occupy a position, or perform the duties  and functions of a position, required by 
the vessel's Certificate of Inspection;  
 -  Perform the duties and functions of patrolmen or watchmen required by Coast 
Guard regulations; or 
-  Are specifically assigned the duties of wa rning, mustering, assembling, assisting, or 
controlling the movement of passengers during em ergencies. 
C.3.c.  Program requirements for uninspected vessels 
A marine em ployer must establish a program for ra ndom drug testing of 
crewmemb ers on uninspected vessels who: 
-  Are required by law or regulation to hol d a Coast Guard issued license to perform 
their duties; 
-  Perform duties and functions directl y related to the safe opera tion of the vessel; 
-  Perform the duties and functions of patrolmen or watchmen required by Coast 
Guard regulations; or 
-  Are specifically assigned the duties of wa rning, mustering, assembling, assisting, or 
controlling the movement of passengers during em ergencies. 
C.4.REASONABLE 
CAUSEC.4.a.  Reasonable cause testing for dangerous drugs  
(46 CFR 16.250) 
A marine employer shall require any cr ewmemb er that is reason ably suspected of 
using a dangerous drug t o be chemically  tested for dangerous drugs.  When the 
marine empl oyer determi nes that reas onable cause to require a test exists, th e 
individual m ust be informed of that f act and directed to provide a urine sample as 
soon as practicable.  The evidence to s upport the establishment of reasonable cause, 
the direction  given to the crewmemb er to pr ovide a sample, and any refusal or other 
response should be documented.  On vessels that are required to have an of ficial 
ship's log, the above information shall be entered i n the logbook. 
A reasonable cause drug test shall be d one in accor dance with 4 9 CFR Part 40. 
C.4.a.1.  Definition of reasonably suspected 
Reasonably s uspected or r easonable cause me ans a probability exists, based on some 
evidence, tha t a crewm ember has used a dangerous drug.  Generally, this should be 
based on direct observati on of specific, contempo raneous phys ical, behavioral, or 
performance indicators of probable use.  Where practicable, th ese observations 
should have been made by two persons in supervisory positions.  Indicators include 
but are not li mited to: 
-  An individual's speech (slurred and inc oherent), behavior (lack of coordination 
and balance), or appearance; 
-  Drugs and drug paraphernalia in clothing and personal property, or concealed in 
staterooms o r elsewhere; or 
-  Smoke, breath and bod y odors. 
-  Since illnes s, injury, or o ther factors, as well as drugs could cause these 
circumstances and conditi ons, the deci sion to test f or reasonable cause must be 
 made with p rudence and common sen se. 
C.4.b.  Reasonable cause testing for intoxication (33 
CFR 95.035) 
These regulations apply to all vessels (commerc ial, recreational, domestic or foreign) 
on U. S. waters.  Only a marine empl oyer or a law enforcemen t officer may direct an 
individual op erating a vessel to undergo a chemical test for evidence of drug or 
alcohol use. Reasonable cause exist when: 
-  The individual was directly involved in the occur rence of a m arine casualty; or 
-  The individual is suspected of being in toxicated, which can be established by 
direct observation of the individual’s op eration of any vessel and  there is an 
apparent effect of the into xicant(s) con sumed by th e individual on the perso n's 
manner, disposition, speech, muscular mo vement, general appearance or behavior. 
Where practi cable, these observations shou ld have been made by two persons.  
When the in dividual is directed to un dergo a chemical test, th e individual must be 
informed of that fact and directed to u ndergo a test as soon as p racticable.  
Unlike mandatory chemi cal testing after a SM I, chemical tests a re not autom atically 
required whenever an individual is involved in a marine casualty.  Good judgment 
and careful consideration of the seriousne ss and circumstances of a marine casualty 
shall be exercised before directing chem ical testing.  A chemical test for drugs 
directed und er this autho rity should be conducted in accordance with 49 CFR 40. 
C.5.POST 
ACCIDENTPost accident drug and alcohol testing regulations apply to all U.S. commercial 
vessels operating anywher e in the worl d and all foreign-flagged vessels operati ng 
upon the navigable waters of the U.S. 
C.5.a.  Reportable marine casualties 
Following every marine casualty repor table to the Coast Guard under 46 CFR 4.05-
10 (i.e., Reportable Marine Casualties),  the marine employer must determine 
whether th ere is any evidence of alco hol or  drug use by the individuals direc tly 
involved.  Such evidence may include chem ical tests for drugs and alcohol.  Any 
evidence mu st be preserved and reported to th e Coast Guard. 
C.5.b.  SMI or Probable SMI Casualties 
When a mari ne casualty o ccurs, the m arine employer must mak e a timely, go od faith 
determinatio n as to whether the occu rrence is or is likely to become a SMI.  A 
marine employer shall require all pers ons engaged or employed on board the 
vessel(s) wh om the empl oyer determi nes to be directly involved to be chem ically 
tested for dangerous drugs and alcohol .  An individual whose order, action or failure 
to act is determined to have, or cannot be  ruled out as, having caused or con tributed 
to a SMI can be considered "directly i nvolved".  A law enforcement officer may also 
determine th at a person was directly i nvolved .  If this happens, the marine employer 
 shall then ta ke all practicable steps to collect a sam ple.   
46 CFR 4.06-3 C.5.c.  Collection timeframe 
Individuals o rdered to be tested shoul d not leave their duties in the aftermath of an 
incident when their performance is necessary  to sa ve lives or property, or to protect 
the environment.  Individuals required to be tes ted are not to drink any beverage 
that con tains alcohol, including mouthwashe s until after the tes t has been con ducted 
or after eight hours form the time of S MI.  It is the responsibility of the marine 
employer to ensure that the alcohol test s are condu cted within 2  hours and urine 
samples are collected wi thin 32 hours of a SMI unless precluded by safety concerns 
directly related to the inci dent.  If saf ety concerns do not allow testing within 2 
hours or collection of a u rine sample within 32 hours, the testi ng/collection must be 
completed as soon as the saf ety concerns have been  addressed.  Alcohol testi ng is 
not required to be conducted more tha n eight hours after the SMI.  Whenever 
possible, efforts can be made to ens ure that a la w enforcement officer conduct the 
alcohol test i f such testing would be more ti mely than testing arranged by the marine 
employer, or if there is any concern th at testing wo uld not other wise be 
accomplished.  Marine employers are required to have the dru g test specim ens 
collected wi thin 32 hours of the incident.  If this is not possible, the drug test 
specimens s hould be collected as soo n as possible after the incident. 
C.5.d.  Post Accident Testing Reporting Requirements 
A Coast Guard form CG-2692B, Report of Required Chemical Drug and Alcohol 
Testing Following a Serious Marine Incide nt, mus t be submitted to the appr opriate 
Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection followi ng any serious marine incident.  If 
alcohol tests cannot be co nducted with in 8 hours or urine samples are not co llected 
within 32 hours of the SMI or immedia tely after the safety con cerns have b een 
addressed, the reason why must be docu mented on form CG-2692B.  This form 
should be submitted with  a form CG-2692, Report of Marine Accident, Injury or 
Death.  All p ersons tested , regardless of ci tizenship, or whether or not they h ave 
MMCs shall be indicated on the CG-2692B.  The d rug test results will not always be 
available wh en the CG-2692 and CG-2692B are submitted, ther efore the ma rine 
employer mu st report the test results, p ositive or negative, when they receive them.  
D.POSITIVE/NON-NEGATIVE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTS
D.1.POSITIVE 
DRUG TEST DEFINEDA positive drug test of a urine sample is a test result that a desig nated Medical 
Review Officer (MRO) v erifies as positive fo r one or more drugs or drug classes.  
The marine employer mu st ensure tha t all test resul ts are sent from the SAM HSA 
certified laboratory to the employer's designated MRO for verification.  The 
verification process involves the MRO contacting the employee with the la b 
confirmed positive test a nd conducti ng an  interview to determ ine if there is a 
legitimate ex planation for the positive test.  Only when the MR O verifies a person's 
 confirmed positive test result from the lab and rep orts the test as positive to  the 
marine empl oyer has that person then  failed the drug test.  The MRO also reviews 
the chain-of-custody and other proced ures to insure that there i s no possibility of 
error or "mix-up".  If there is a legitima te explana tion or a possibility of error, the 
MRO will either cancel the test or downgrade it to a “negative test”. 
The use of marijuana for medicinal purpos es, the ingestion of marijuana th at has 
been added to prepared food products (i.e., brownies, pasta), or the passive 
inhalation of marijuana smoke or the envir onmental exposure or accidental  ingestion 
of any drug or drug class is not a valid reason for the MRO to determine a negative 
test result. See 46 CFR 40.151. 
D.2.NON-
NEGATIVE DRUG TEST 
DEFINEDA non-negative drug test of a urine sample is a test result that a designated Medical 
Review Officer (MRO) v erifies as adulterated  or su bstituted.  These test res ults are 
to be consid ered a refusal to test and are a primary indication that the m ariner has 
attemp ted to  subvert the testing process.  Adulterated is when a n additive ha s been 
added to th e urine specimen to “mask” the presen ce of a drug.  Substituted is when 
the specific gravity and creatinine valu es are so low that th e submitted speci men is 
considered not consistent with normal human urine.  A substitu ted specimen  can be 
the result of ingesting large quantities of fl uids o r using a liquid that will look like 
urine, i.e., apple juice, lemonade. 
The marine employer mu st ensure tha t all test resul ts are sent from the SAM HSA 
certified laboratory to the employer's designated MRO for verification.  The 
verification process involves the MRO contacting the employee with the la b 
confirmed adulterated or  substituted test  result and  conducting an interview to 
determine if the is a legitimate explana tion for the test result.  Only when the MRO 
verifies a person's confirmed adultera ted and/or s ubstituted test result from the lab 
and reports the test as ad ulterated and /or substituted to the m arine employer has 
that person then refused to take the dr ug test.  The MRO also reviews the ch ain-of-
custody and other proced ures to insure that there i s no possibility of error or "mix-
up".  If there is a legitimate explanatio n or a possibility of error, the MRO wi ll either 
cancel th e test or downgrade it to a “n egative test”
D.3.REPORTS OF 
POSITIVE AND NON -
NEGATIVE TESTSMarine employers must report positive tests  to the Coast Guar d for persons holding 
MMCs.  Additionally, marine employer s must report any non-negative drug t est 
results to Coast Guard for MMC hold ers. 
D.4.NEGATIVE –
DILUTE DRUG TEST 
REPORTSOn occasions, drug test will be reported as negative dilute by the MRO to the marine 
employer.  When certai n test level criteria (specific gravity and creatinine) are met, 
the MRO will direct the marine empl oyer to  send the individual immediatel y for 
another tes t using direct observation collecti on procedures.  If the test repo rt is 
negative dilute again, that will be the final test result.  No further action is required to 
be taken. 
D.5.
CONSEQUENCES OF 
POSITIVE AND NON-Any crewmember who fails any required drug  test or has a drug test violatio n must 
be removed from duties which directl y affect the s afe operation  of the vessel as soon 
as practicabl e (or denied employmen t in the case o f a pre-employment test) 
 NEGATIVE TEST until/unless the MRO determines that person is  drug free and at low risk to return 
to drug use.  This require ment applies to all persons who fail drug tests, whether or 
not they hol d a MMC.  In addition, the requirements given in 49 CFR part 40, 
subpart O m ust be compl ied with when returning to work. 
D.6.ALCOHOL 
TESTS THAT SHOW THE 
PRESENCE OF 
ALCOHOL. Alcohol tests that are perf ormed with a br eath testi ng device will show the pr esence 
of alcohol a level of 0.02 BAC or high er.  The Coast Guard requires one of the 
following three specimen sources for an al cohol tes t:  Blood, saliva and breath.  
Urine specimens that have been tes ted for alcohol are not acceptable. 
E.REFUSAL TO TEST
E.1.GENERAL The marine employer is responsible for assuring t hat drug and alcohol testi ng is 
done, but no  individual can be forced to give a sample for chemical testing.  In 
refusal cases, the individual’s refusal m ust be docu mented, and that person may be 
liable for a civil penalty a nd/or be subject to Coas t Guard acti on against th eir 
MMCs for t hat refusal to test. 
E.1.a.  Refusals by Individuals with MMCs 
Employees must provide a urine sam ple for drug testing, and a  blood, saliva or 
breath sampl e for alcohol testing, when directed by their marine employer.  An 
employee cannot be compelled to sub mit to  drug or alcohol testing, however a 
refusal to test by an empl oyee is consi dered misco nduct.  S&R proceedings and/or 
civil penalty actions should be taken a gainst employees who ref use to test. 
E.1.b.  Refusals by Individuals without MMCs 
Employees must provide a urine sam ple for drug testing, and a  blood, saliva or 
breath sampl e for alcohol testing, when directed by their marine employer.  An 
employee cannot be compelled to sub mit to  drug or alcohol testing, however a 
refusal to test by an empl oyee shall be reason for immediate removal of the 
employee fro m being employed in a safety-sensitive position. 
F.DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROGRAM INSPECTOR (DAPI) 
F.1.WHAT IS A 
DAPI? A Drug and Alcohol Program Inspector (DAPI) is a Coast Guard inspector whose 
primary focus is to increase compliance with  the ch emical testin g requirements in the 
marine industry. 
A DAPI has two roles.  First, they are to  educate an d assist marine employer s in 
 developing a compliant chemical tes ting progra m.  Although it is unrealistic to expect 
a DAPI to visit each and every marine empl oyer wi thin his or her district, they are 
expected to respond to an y questions o r problems a marine empl oyer might have. 
The DAPIs second role is to enforce the chemical testing regulations.  DAPIs will 
conduct vess el inspection s and visit marine  employers within th e District to ensure 
compliance with the chemical testing regu lations.  The scope of  the inspecti ons will 
include record keeping and reporting, sp ecimen col lection, Medical Review Officer 
activities, em ployee assistance programs, pr oper designation of crewmemb ers to be 
tested, and p roper conduct of required tests. 
DAPI positions were established in the geographical center of the applicabl e vessel 
distribution in each district.  The ports  where DAPIs are located are Providence, 
Norfolk, Miami, New Orleans, St. Louis, Toledo, San Francisco Bay area, Portland 
(Oregon), Honolulu, and Anchorage.  DAPIs are required to travel throughout each 
district, to create and foster an extensi ve ou treach program.  A DAPI can b e assigned 
to either the local District office or Dist rict Sector Office. Due to the na ture of the 
DAPI position, units with DAPIs should not assign the DAPI collateral duties or 
other responsibilities (e.g. morale officer).
F.2.DAPI
ENFORCEMENT TOOLSDAPIs have several enforcement tools  availa ble to them in the event they en counter 
noncomplian ce.  For inspected vessels , a DA PI may pull a vessel’s Certificate of 
Inspection o r issue a civil penalty.  For uninspected vessels, a DAPI may o btain a 
Captain of the Port Order, which prevents a vessel from operating.  Civil penalties can 
also be issued to operator s of uninspected ve ssels.  Individuals refusing to participate 
in a chemical  testing program can be is sued civil penalties.  Furthermore, holders of 
Coast Guard  licenses or Merchant Mariner documents (MMDs) may b e subject to 
suspension and revocatio n proceedings. 
F.3.CHEMICAL 
TESTING PROGRAM 
AUDITSThere are two checklists that have been  developed for use by DAPIs and vessel 
inspectors. 
The first checklist is a simple five questions with mi nimal proof requirements being 
sought by a vessel inspector.  The purpose is a simple complian ce tool.  If there are 
no apparent surface problems with th e drug  test program and other aspects of the 
vessel inspection, the drug test program audit may be considered complete. 
The second checklist is more detailed and is for use by a DAPI when doing a full 
audit of a marine employer’s drug and alc ohol test program.  This audit tool will be 
done when q uestions or concerns have arisen concerning compliance have been 
brought to the attention of Coast Guard. 
Both of thes e checklists a re available on request from CG-545. 
F.4.DAPIPQS Newly assigned DAPIs will be required to complete a set of Program Qualification 
Standards (PQS).  The PQS will focus on applicable laws and regulations pertaining to 
chemical testing as well as audits or inspections of a  marine empl oyer’s chemi cal 
testing program. 
 While not a requirement, it is desirable that  DAPIs have an Investigations background 
(e.g. complete Investigating Officer’s Course, obtain Investigator Qualifications).  It is 
highly recommended tha t those individuals who are newly assigned to a D API billet 
and new to the Marine Safety program recei ve no less than 2 weeks OJT with a Coast 
Guard Inspector and 2 weeks with a Coast Guard  Investigator.  
G.LETTERS OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
G.1.WHAT IS A 
LETTER OF 
REGULATORY 
COMPLIANCE 
(LORC)? A Letter of Regulatory Compliance (L ORC)  is a letter from Commandant (CG-545) 
that states th at the Co ast Guard has re viewed the d rug and alcohol program for a 
marine empl oyer, (or con sortium), and that chemical testing p olicy meets the intent of 
the regulations set forth in the Coast Guard regulations found at 46 CFR parts 4 and 
16 and the DOT regulations found at 49 CFR part 40.  An LORC is not a Coast 
Guard appr oval or endorsement  for a company.   It is a Coast Guard 
acknowledgement tha t the subject pro gram has been reviewed a nd is not deficient in 
meeting the regulatory requirements a nd procedures. 
G.2.ARE 
LORC’S REQUIRED ? A marine employer is not required to obtain an LORC.   However, by obtaining 
an LORC, the drug and alcohol program audit performed annually by the Coast 
Guard will potentially go smoother for a mari ne employer.  An inspector wi ll not have 
to dedicate extensive time and energy audi ting the drug and alcohol testing program 
because th e Coast Guard  (CG-545) has al ready reviewed the p rogram and determined 
that it is not deficient in its form.
G.3.HOW ARE 
LORC’S OBATINED ? The standard s that a marine employer or a Consortia/Third Party Administr ator 
(C/TPA) ca n be found at http://ho meport.uscg.mil    Mission s>Investigations>Drug 
and Alcohol Program “Le tters of Regulatory Compl iance”.  These standards are 
available in Word and Adobe format for download and compl etion.  There are 
instructions on this site for completio n of the stan dards.  Regulatory text is not to be 
submitted bu t rather how shall a marine empl oyer or C/TPA, in their language, will 
implement and operate their program  is being sought. 
After a marine employer or consortium has develo ped a written  drug and alcohol 
testing program, they sho uld contact the local Coa st Guard District Drug & Alcohol 
Program Inspector (D API).  The DAPI contact in formation can be found at 
http://homeport.uscg.mil     Missions>Investigations>Drug and Alcohol Program 
“Nationwide DPAI Program Contact I nformation”.  The DAPIs should be able to 
guide marine employers d uring the development ph ase of their chemical tes ting 
program, as well as the revi ewing stage.  The DAPI can review the program locally to 
check for compliance with the regulations.  Should some aspect of the program be 
deficient the local DAPI will work with the marine employer or consortium in making 
corrections.  After the local DAPI has reviewed  the program, it will be forwarded to 
Coast Guard  Headquarter s in Washington, DC for a final review. When the program 
 is determined to be in compliance with the regulations, Commandant CG-545 will 
issue an LORC, which should be kept with their chemical testing program.

Criminal Enforcement  
 
THIS PAGE IN TENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
 A.CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT PROCESS
A.1.GENERAL This Chapter provides guidance for Mari ne Safety personnel co nducting operations 
that ma y result in criminal enforcement and is intended to ensu re a uniform process 
for all marine safety pers onnel to follow.  All marine safety per sonnel that conduct 
field activities should be familiar with this policy.  The Coast Guard is the primary 
federal agency responsible for the enforcement of l aws and treaties of the U.S. on the 
high seas, in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ),  in coastal ar eas, and in and along 
the navigable waters of th e U.S.  Many of these laws provide for administrative, civil 
and criminal sanctions for violations of statutory requirements or implementing 
regulations.  Some of thes e laws autho rize criminal sanctions for negligent conduct, 
some require knowing or willful misco nduct, and some establish strict criminal 
liability for violations.  It is extremely  important that  investigations of po tential 
violations of laws that c onducted by ma rine safety personnel are performed in 
a manner that will protect all enforc ement options.  Marine s afety units a nd 
personnel, should work in concert with th e Department of Justice (DOJ) an d other 
federal, state, and local agencies, to effectively use r esources in support of any 
criminal prosecution in which the Coast Guard has  jurisdiction.   
In addition to the guidance below th e Maritime Law Enforcem ent Manual (MLEM), 
COMDTINSTR M16247.1D, Chapter 11, Vessel Safety; App endix C, Statutory 
reference; an d Appendix G ,Case Package Preparation provides guidance on criminal 
law enforcement. 
For specific guidance related to law en forcem ent procedures ass ociated with marine 
pollution  refer to Maritime Law Enforcement M anual (MLEM), COMDTINSTR 
M16247.1D, Chapter 9, Marine/Envir onmental Pollution Law Enforcemen t. 
A.2.POLICY AND 
PROCEDURAL 
OVERVIEWMarine safety personnel actively enfo rce laws by d etecting, investigating, and 
reporting violations of law.  In general, the role of marine safety units and personnel 
is early detection and prompt reporting of  potential violations so the cognizant 
District Com mander can, in accordance wi th 33 C.F.R. § 1.07-90, determine whether 
to pursue referring the matter to the De partmen t of Justice (DOJ) for criminal 
prosecution.  While that d etermination  someti mes needs to be made very q uickly, it 
must neverth eless be based on a reaso ned assessm ent of accura tely transmitted facts 
and recomm endations.  Potential crimi nal violations should be reported with out delay 
to ensure a p roper investigation is conducted.  District Comma nders should ensure 
there is sufficient evidence of a suspected criminal violation prior to referrin g a case 
to DOJ.  District legal sta ffs and the Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) 
should be consulted and can assist with in vestigative resources, legal expertise, and 
liaison with federal prosecutors in evaluati ng each case and advis ing the District 
Commander on referring the case for prosecu tion.  Although U.S. Attorneys do not 
need a referral from the Coast Guard  to prosecute a case, the r eferral process 
 provides a standardized, Coast Guard -wide mechanism for bringing import ant cases 
to the a ttenti on of the ap propriate U.S. Attorney.  Additionally, since the U.S. 
Attorney do es not require a Coast Gu ard referral to prosecute a case, the C oast 
Guard must act quickly to ensure the Dist rict Commander is prepared to res pond 
favorably or unfavorably to the Depart ment of Justice (DOJ) regarding the 
prosecution of potential criminal cases of which the Coast Guard has primary 
jurisdiction. 
B.RESPONSIBILITIES DURING CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT 
PROCEDURES
B.1.MARINE 
SAFETY PERSONNELMarine safety personnel are the first line of defense against the violation of laws in 
the marine environment.  As such they should be extremely familiar with this 
Chapter. 
B.2.SENIOR 
INVESTIGATING 
OFFICER (SIO) For all instances in which ma rine safety units and p ersonnel detect potential criminal 
activity the Senior Investigating Office r (SIO) will coordinate communications 
between the unit, the District Comma nder, D(m) a nd D(l).  The District Commander 
will interface with the Coast Guard Investigative Service.   
B.3.CAPTAIN OF 
THE PORT (COTP)/
OFFICER IN CHARGE,
MARINE INSPECTION 
(OCMI)/
COMMANDING OFFICERIn most cases the enforcement of laws  over which the Coast Gu ard has jurisdiction is 
the responsibility of the Captain of the Port (COTP), Officer in Charge, Marine 
Inspection (OCMI), and/or Commanding Officers of Sectors and marine s afety 
units.   
B.4.DISTRICT 
COMMANDER (1)  Each Di strict’s Prevention Divisi on provides subject matter  oversight and 
guidance on all marine safety and envi ronmental protection issu es.  They are the link 
with higher Coast Guard authority on such issues and the supply source for any 
additional marine safety or environmental pr otection resources that ma y be required. 
(2) The Distr ict Legal Office is responsible for advising the District Commander on 
all criminal referrals, coordinating the Dist rict Com mander’s referral of criminal cases 
to DOJ, and acting as the designated lia ison point with DOJ for all referrals and 
litigation matters, and prosecuting all Cla ss II civil penalties un der the CW A.  The 
Legal Office will advise on the sufficiency of evidence to meet the standard of proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt, on the elements of various offenses, and on restrictions 
on enforcement action under domestic and international law.  The Legal Office will 
also provide guidance on an appropriate s ecurity in lieu of withholding customs 
clearance in all cases with  significan t potential for criminal referral.  
B.5.COAST GUARD 
INVESTIGATIVE 
SERVICE (CGIS) CGIS Agents work for the Command ant under th e direction o f the regional Special 
Agent in Ch arge.  CGIS Agents are a vailable to investigate criminal violations of all 
laws enforced by the Coa st Guard.  While CGIS agents do don’t directly exercise 14 
 USC 89(a) authority, they can assist u niformed personnel who pose that au thority 
during a Coast Guard inspections, investigat ions or other boarding. The request for 
an agent’s services on a case should be made thro ugh a unit’s commanding officer.  
Oral requests should be followed by written confirmation.  Where criminal activity is 
suspected, C ommanding officers requesting CGIS services should also consult with 
the servicing District legal office.  CGIS should be notified and consulted regarding 
all cases that may be refer red to DOJ for criminal prosecution.  CGIS Agents are 
trained criminal investigators who are familiar with the legal issues associated with the 
prosecution of a criminal case.  Additi onally, CGIS Agents regularly work with agents 
of other Federal, State, and local law en forcement agencies an d frequently become 
aware of violations of environmental la ws and ongoing criminal investigations 
through these sources.  Frequently, after a case is a ccepted for prosecution, but 
before it goes to trial, the DOJ attorney prosecutin g the case wi ll require case 
investigation assistance in the form of service of grand jury subpoenas, further 
witness inter rogation or other such follow-up.  While it is often difficult fo r IO’s and 
inspectors  to commit the time necess ary to fulfill t his need, a CGIS Agent can serve 
as “case agen t” for DOJ Attorneys on  Coast Guar d investigations and have 
experience in  performing this function.  All unit commanders should keep in mind 
that, once a case is accep ted for criminal  investigation by CGIS, CGIS agents are 
required to follow procedures outlined in the CGIS Investigations Manual, 
COMDTINST M552 7.1 (series), including procedures on briefing the chain of 
command o n cases being  investigated.
B.6.DEPARTMENT 
OF JUSTICEDOJ makes the final decision on whether, and under what cond itions, to prosecute 
criminal violations of  marine safety and environmental laws.  Primary responsibility 
for the approval and prosecution rests with the U.S. Attorney’s  office in the judicial 
district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred.  Criminal enforcem ent of 
marine environmental pr otection laws  might also involve DOJ Environmental 
Crimes Section in Washington, DC, via an agreem ent with cog nizant U.S. Attorney’s 
office.  The effective investigation an d successful prosecution of criminal cases often 
requires early consultation with DOJ.  Conse quentl y, it is imperative that all Coast 
Guard offices and units coordinate as soon as possible, through the District Legal 
Office, with the U.S. Atto rney’s office.  For any case which ma y result in referral to 
DOJ, consultation with the District Legal Office is required prior to any co operative 
work with federal prosecutors in order to assure proper use of Coast Guard 
authorities. Such early co nsultations ensur e coordination during rapidly developing 
investigations, help to develop consensus regarding the appropriate focus of 
investigative efforts, and avoid the unproductive use of investigative resources.  To 
avoid potential 4th amendment suppression issues, DOJ should not be consulted on 
the specific facts of an in vestigation during a boarding by Coast Guard inspectors or 
investigators whereby th ey are ex ercising 14 USC 89a authority. 
B.7.
FEDERAL/STATE 
AGENCIESUnder 14 U.S.C. § 141(b), the Coast Guard is  authorized to av ail itself of o fficers, 
employees, advice, information and facilities of Federal, State or local government 
agencies as may be helpf ul in the perfor mance of its duties.  U.S. maritime law 
 enforcement efforts involve many agencies.  Intera gency coordination of effort has 
been established through Memorandums of Understanding, Memorandums of 
Agreement, and Interagency Agreements, and thes e documents  are contained in 
Volume X of the MSM.   Many states have significant environmental crimi nal 
enforcement programs and resources that can be utilized as additional sources of 
expertise and  resources in dealing with criminal investigations of environmental law 
violations.  Examples are forensic labor atories, HAZMAT testing, surveillance 
equipment, and so on.  When State or loca l government personnel are utilized under 
the authority of 14 U.S.C. § 141(b), the Coast  Guar d is authorized to make p ayments 
for per diem and travel for these perso ns to the sa me extent pr escribed for Federal 
employees.  Coast Guard  investigators should attempt to identi fy State and l ocal 
environmental enforcement agencies, s ervices and other resources that could assist in 
investigation of environm ental violations.   
B.8.
ENVIRONMENTAL 
CRIMES TASK FORCESMany U.S. Attorney offices and State l aw enforcem ent offices have formed 
Environmental Crimes Task Forces to addr ess the problems inherent in coordinating 
enforcement actions by the numerous Federal, State and local la w enforcement 
agencies that have jurisdiction over envir onmental crimes.  The focus and makeup of 
these task fo rces differ depending on the individual U.S. Attorney or State a gency 
that established the task f orce.  Coast Guard participation in these task forces serve as 
a good means to inform other enforcement agencies of Coast Guard missions and 
interests in the environmental area, to  establish a means of co ordinating enforcement 
actions amo ng agencies for major environmental cases, to identify resources and 
capabilities outside of the Coast Guard th at may be useful in accomplishing Coast 
Guard missions, and to establish good working re lationships among enforcement 
agencies and  prosecuting attorneys inv olved in the enforcement of environmental 
laws.  Task forces shall not be used as a referral process for Coast Guard cases. 
C.MARINE INVESTIGATIONS
C.1.GENERAL The Coast Guard conducts marine investigat ions under various legal authorities for a 
variety of purposes, including detectio n of admi nistrative, civil, and criminal offenses, 
determinatio n of causes, and creation of safety alerts and recom mendations.  These 
investigations begin with no presumption of criminal or civil misconduct.  The results 
of any Coast Guard investigation, however, ma y be used as part of a criminal, civil or 
other enforcement a ction  where such enforcement action is deemed appropriate and 
necessary.  Because th e criminal offenses involved may not be r eadily apparent at th e 
outset, it is critical that all marine inve stigators (including pollut ion investigators) 
conduct their investigations in a fashion that will preserve the ev idence and f acts for 
use in a criminal setting.  It is similarly critical that all marine investigators be 
conversant in the crimin al offenses that the Co ast Guard enforces.  Where an 
apparent cri minal offense is detected during  the course of an investigation, marine 
investigators should seek the advice of their servicing legal office.  Further, where 
Title 18, U.S. Code offenses are detected , marine investigators should seek the 
 involvement of the CGIS through their District Commander.   The SIO is 
responsible for all such coordination.
